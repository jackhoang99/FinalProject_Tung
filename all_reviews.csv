earthhero.com,Brandon Roberts,5.4K reviews,US,"Mar 5, 2024","Been a long time EH customerBeen a long time customer with EarthHero and they always have all the sustainable products that I need at an affordable price. One thing i noticed is certain products on their store you can buy at a lower price on a subscription and that option is set to default, so there was one time that when i purchased i forgot to select ""one time"" instead of ""subscription"" and was shipped a an order I did not really need. They're customer service is great though, and they worked with me on cancelling those and even giving me a store credit for the inconvenience! Happy to have another option that is more sustainable than Amazon :) Date of experience: March 04, 2024",5

earthhero.com,Connie Stahle,4 reviews,US,"Oct 28, 2020","Poor quality product and customer careNo cushion at all in sole, think of walking on a thin layer of suede and boiled wool. Not my idea of quality or comfort in a slipper. My fault was that i gave them a chance and wore them for about 20-30 minutes inside my home but got a small stain on the suede soles. Since they don't stand behind their quality they emphasize that they cannot accept returns unless they are unused and in same condition as arrived. I do understand trying to avoid someone sending back shoes wore for a year but i also understand good customer service and looking at a long term profit of satisfied customers vs a short term profit of get every buck you can despite the customer satisfaction.Buyer beware, you will not be valued.Date of experience: October 28, 2020",1

earthhero.com,Nancy B,2 reviews,US,"Feb 17, 2023","Beware: This company repeatedly sells Out of Stock itemsTwice this company sold me a duffel bag and, after taking my money they wrote the next day to say the color I wanted was out of stock. I did get the money refunded, but EarthHero obviously kept ALL of my credit card information on its site. Yesterday my daughter (for whom I bought the duffel) informed me that the color (Green). When I went to purchase the item, the site had ALL my credit card info., including the security code. I thought that was strange that I wasn't prompted to fill it in. Less than 24 hours after EarthHero charged my credit card, I got an email saying that the item was Out of Stock and trying to cajole me to settle for an entirely different color. I wonder if there were any green bags after all? I know that I will be refunded, but it irks me that they still have all my credit card information. I have asked them to scrub it. I would never buy anything from this company again.Date of experience: February 16, 2023",1
earthhero.com,BAF,1 review,US,"Jul 13, 2022","Not Actually SustainableThis company does not have sustainability at its core. Of course businesses need to make money, but when a company says it values sustainability above all else and helping consumers be more sustainable, they should not make concessions to make more money. There are many brands they have on their website that go against EarthHero’s sourcing principles, but they refuse to discontinue those products. I received expired product and the packaging was made from virgin plastic, even after I asked if it was recycled because I thought plastic was not something they carried anyway. It also seems very unusual that they had a diverse team a few months ago and now it is all white employees. Sustainable and ethical go beyond the products a company sells and I do not believe this company walks the walk. There are plenty of other companies that are doing it better so I would encourage others to check out package free or public goods as they are closer to the ideals that EarthHero claims to stand behind.Date of experience: July 13, 2022",1

I have a large capacity machine, but use just 1 sheet of the non-bio unscented for most loads, and 2 sheets if it's a particularly large / grubby load (we have hard water). I particularly love how simply clean the laundry smells. No need for fabric conditioner either - I just add some white/distilled vinegar to the drawer for things like towels.Date of experience: May 12, 2024",5

I trialled them at home before moving them into use in my off grid, eco hospitality business. Am very happy with the results. At first I thought the colours of the sprays were a bit bright for things that are supposed to be so gentle. But the colour coding is useful and keeps everything really simple. I have just purchased a full set of the 4 cleaning sprays for each of my eco cabins and now the cleaning team will ONLY use these sprays as we can trust they are gentle and safe for our off grid waste water treatment. Plus we won't be throwing out empty bottles when they run out, the team will simply be dropping another tab into the bottle, filling it up with water and off we go. We tell our guests about everything we use in our cabins - we're excited to tell them about our switch to The Green Company.Date of experience: May 07, 2024",5

So I quickly went on to stop the repeat order.I'm now left with loads that don’t do the job they’re supposed to do.

We had a couple of questions too about perfume and conditioners so having had a candid and rapid response from The Green Company, we dipped our toes into the water with a couple of sample laundry sheets. Our experience continues to be very positive and even though TGC has discontinued their dishwasher sheets (they're looking for a better solution), we continue to be enthusiastic converts.

thegreencompany.online,Ms Richardson,2 reviews,GB,"Feb 5, 2024","An ingenious and very effective productI initially tried a sample of The Green Company's laundry sheets that had been posted through my door.  I was curious and liked the brand's ethical credentials but not entirely confident that the product would/could work.  However, not only did they wash/clean brilliantly, but were easy to use and smelled really nice (Fresh Linen fragrance).  Having been convinced of their effectiveness I thought that the other great advantage of the laundry sheets for me would be that they take up very little storage compared with my normal powder Non Bio which comes in big bulky boxes.

thegreencompany.online,Antonio Alfei,16 reviews,GB,"May 16, 2023","Great product, laundry sheetsI received my first full order about 3 weeks ago, for the laundry sheets 32 pack, my wife absolutely loves them.She was very sceptical at first as she was a more traditional user of washing powder, but after using these sheets she has been completely hooked, they are great value for money and no bulky packaging and more importantly completely plastic free, so great for the environment, so what’s not to like.As a result I have decided to subscribe to a delivery every month for 32 sheets, which again is flexible  to suit our needs, and can be paused or stopped at any time.Ps we tried a sampler before the full purchase and that convinced us.Date of experience: April 25, 2023",5
thegreencompany.online,kate jupp,4.4K reviews,GB,"Aug 24, 2023","Exceptional product and excellent serviceThe subscription service for the laundry sheets is a game changer. The flexible subscription to meet any change in need means we always have what we need. Being notified of the scheduled order and  date means adjustments can be made in time for next delivery. The lavender laundry sheets clean clothes beautifully, leaving them soft and fresh. Copes well with very dirty (farm) and sports washing and delicates. Too resealable strong paper envelopes holds enough sheets for our family of 4 for 3 months. None of the usual storage problems associated with bulk buying and arrives with usual mail so no delivery stress. Mess free, no plastic and flexible dosage for different load size or heavy soiling- simply tear a sheet in half or use two!I wasn't sure initially as I take pride in my laundry and in keeping clothes looking good for the long term. I am delighted with the results, the service and value. I absolutely recommend this product and will be sticking with our subscription. Fantastic for university students too.Date of experience: August 24, 2023",5

thegreencompany.online,Christine,3 reviews,GB,"Aug 5, 2023","Not very impressedI sent for the free sample Lavender Laundry Detergent Sheets and received them quickly. I excitedly popped one sheet in the washing machine with a few items as described hoping for a good result.  I was wrong as it was no different to Bold for instance.  Really really disappointed 😞.  I thought beforehand I would see how much it would cost to get them every month  £14.95 for 64 washes!! or slightly less for 32. No way I can buy a good quality laundry Detergent for much much less. Not impressed at all.Date of experience: August 05, 2023",1

thegreencompany.online,Thelma Walker,24 reviews,GB,"Jul 5, 2023","Eco products - no plasticI have been using the Laundry detergent sheets for a while now and besides cutting down on my use of plastics I find them great so I was very keen to try the Beeswax wraps.The Beeswax are very easy to use and cleaning them very easy to make their available for another use. This certainly helps to cut down on the amount of cling film that I use.I have also tried the Eco cleaning tablets and find these very effective and I will certainly be using these again.All the products are packaged in cardboard packaging so while cutting down significantly on the use of plastic, they come in easy storable packets.I would strongly recommend trying these products and helping to cut down on the use of plasticsDate of experience: July 03, 2023",5

My washing is clean, fresh and soft: I've stopped using conditioner now, and there is only a slight difference. I am also pleased that they are a natural product, therefore better for our skin, and the environment. Wins all round!Date of experience: June 21, 2023",5

I have always used face cloths which take up space in the washing machine and time to dry. And disposable wipes for travelling which isn’t great.

thegreencompany.online,Chloe,25 reviews,GB,"Nov 22, 2023","Love this company!I love this company! I was looking for non toxic laundry detergent and came across the green company. I noticed that they had a trial which I thought was amazing as I didn't want to go and waste money on products that potentially don't work. I was pleasantly surprised at how effective the sheets were. I didn't expect the washing to actually be cleaned properly and smell nice too! I use the lavender sheets and there's a lovely subtle smell to them. I love how they come in such a small eco friendly box and on subscription so I don't need to worry about figuring out when I need more. I also tried the cleaning tabs and I'm so happy with these too, they smell great and work just as well as any other all purpose cleaner. I use it all around the house and feel better knowing that I'm not spraying chemicals everywhere anymore. Delivery is quick, prices are fair and customer service is fab. I will be sticking with this company for my household essentials! I would recommend to anyone looking to go eco-friendly and reduce toxins in their home. :)Date of experience: November 22, 2023",5
