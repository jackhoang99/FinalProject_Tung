Eco-friendly birthday decor?,"I'm planning my son's first birthday party.

I'm wondering whether it is okay to use balloons? 
Somehow my mind feels like it is very not eco-friendly but I also order food delivery often, so I don't know why my brain feels like I shouldn't use balloons.

But at the same time, the balloons decors are so cute! And I want my baby and guests feel the celebration.",3,9,2023-12-05 06:29:05,Keykeylimelime,EcoFriendly

Non-toxic eco-friendly dishwashing products,"I‚Äôm looking to replace my dishwashing pods from Cascade Platinum Plus to something better for the environment. I read that the dishwasher pods, even thought dissolve in water, still contain micro plastics that join the ocean.

I came across Blueland products. Though expensive, their tablets seem to be non-toxic. Has anyone used these products before? I‚Äôm worried if they damage the dishwasher by clogging if improperly dissolved.

Update: I‚Äôve been using Blueland for a few months now and I see soap residue powder stuck to the coffee mugs and the none of the dishes were washed properly today, and I had to manually rewash all of them. I thought I had crammed a lot into the dishwasher but even the spoons and forks being in their own slots weren‚Äôt clean. I‚Äôm planning to get through the rest of the tablets with very small loads but will try something else. ",7,14,2023-09-22 16:29:14,rndm_redtr,EcoFriendly
Best eco-friendly laundry basket/bag?,"Hello, I'm looking for an eco-friendly laundry basket or bag. Basically, I just need something to carry my dirty laundry to the washing machine. (I'm not looking for a hamper as I already have one of those, but rather something easy to load and carry.) I'm pretty open to anything as long as it can be cleaned without too much difficulty if necessary, which leaves me thinking my main options are something with a smooth surface that can be wiped down or a machine washable bag or liner.

Any handy names of straightforward eco-friendly or sustainability rating platforms?,"Hello guys, Quick question ‚Äì I've been really into making mindful choices about what I buy, and my friends say I'm turning into a bit of a sustainability nerd.

A friend suggested checking out some rating platforms to take over some of the research from my end, but I don‚Äôt want to rely on random Google SEO recommendations, that's why asking you all people.

best eco-friendly shipping supplies and suppliers? {US},"TL;DR: what are the best ‚Äúeco-friendly‚Äù shipping supplies to use? - biodegradable, recyclable or compostable? what companies are the best to buy from / legit? {preferably with a low MOQ, that ships to the US} 


i‚Äôm looking to declutter my apartment and will be selling things online. i‚Äôd like to be more environmentally conscious with the materials in which i ship things, but i‚Äôm not sure where to start. 

biodegradable? recyclable? compostable? which is ‚Äúbest‚Äù ? 

what companies are legit? {ideally with a lower MOQ. i‚Äôm not a business and i don‚Äôt have *that* many things to discard}

i know i‚Äôll need poly mailers and padded mailers - those are my priorities. followed by inner poly bags, bubble wrap, shipping labels, tape. 

sadly, many people i know don‚Äôt recycle at home. some cities are very strict on what they allow to be recycled too, so a lot of things get tossed in the regular trash bin. and from what i‚Äôve seen, many of the ‚Äúcompostable‚Äù mailers require industrial composting. for the ones that are OK for home composting take half a year to do so, and i‚Äôm not sure if the average person even has a home compost set up either. 

i‚Äôm really hoping to find something that is most convenient for the person who gets it. or in a perfect world, something that won‚Äôt be the *worst* thing if it gets chucked in with the regular trash. does something like that exist?!",3,2,2024-01-06 06:44:56,go-beach,EcoFriendly

Eco-friendly lighter or similar,"I'm new to the sub, so please let me know where I can improve my question for your group.

I need focused heat to shrink wrap paracord shoelaces. Paracord is not ideal, I know, but for me, the length of time it is functional eases the environmental impact of its use. To keep the paracord from fraying, I shrink wrap the ends. The problem is that I need to ""close"" the paracord by melting it a bit then I need to shrink wrap those ends. To do that, an old butane lighter is the perfect thing. It's a small, direct heat that does the job very quickly. However, butane is not shelf-stable (it degrades slowly over time), so the fact that I use it only once a year is a problem. Battery-powered lighters are ok, but batteries are also not ideal to just leave on the shelf for most of the year. So, what I need is a plug-in electric lighter, but that doesn't happen because people generally want lighters to be mobile. Hair dryers don't provide enough heat in a small enough area. Glue guns are too focused and generally need direct contact which causes problems.

I'm trying this sub because eco people will be trying different things to reduce their usage, and they may have encountered this issue. Eco people are also into solving weird little problems like this. Usually :) Any advice would be so welcome. Thanks!",5,6,2022-01-12 21:56:53,phethpwar,EcoFriendly

Are eco-friendly methods REALLY a step forward to helping the planet?,"When you want to save water by using the same bucket for two different things, when it goes to the treatment plant doesn't it take pretty much the *same* amount of energy and chemicals to convert it back to a consumable quality used by people, crops etc, as it takes to treat *two* buckets of water that you would use for the same two things?

When you eat food then poop afterwards, wouldn't the chemicals and electricity used for treating the waste to be converted back into considerably non-hazardous matter again, be pretty much as environmentally harmful as the gases that rotting food waste emits into the atmosphere? I mean the bacteria-killing chemicals need energy and resources to make as well, and the equipment used in sewage plants consumes electricity too, a good amount of which is usually generated using non-renewable means. 

When you recycle plastic food containers, wouldn't the energy needed to process the material harm the environment pretty ""equivalently"", so-to-speak, as it takes to use water to clean the food residue out since the water needs to, well, be processed again, which takes energy and chemicals etc?

etc etc i hope u get what i mean.

From what I've seen online so far, ships tend to pollute more than planes and I couldn't live with myself knowing that they do and still boarding one (feel free to educate me! I'm new to the eco-friendly lifestyle :)). I've been trying to find eco-friendly passenger ships however to no avail. Any searches that I do, either give me cruise ships that just do a circle around a small specific area (I'm looking for crossing the oceans to reach a different land kind of ships), or gives me results of ships that transport goods. 

The lower the pollution rates of the ship the better, preferably less polluting than planes. Honestly, my ideal ship would be wind and row powered lmao, it's a pirate's life for me :)

Eco-friendly way to dispose of old textbooks?,"Hi all,

So, Im a relative novice when it comes to being green, but I am slowly making more conscious decisions to look for more sustainable solutions. I currently have maybe around 30 or so college textbooks that I need to get rid of.

Now, these are OLD textbooks from like 15 years ago, so no one is really looking to take them off my hands for school at this point (Ive already given away test books and other materials that would still provide a service even if they are older editions). I imagine because of their age, local libraries won‚Äôt be interested in them as a donation, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like throwing them in a recycling bin is the right move here either.

Does anyone know where I could either get these books recycled for materials or organizations that could give them a second life? I live in the US, if that matters.",11,6,2022-02-09 01:57:48,GrindinMolcajete,EcoFriendly

The goodness of eco-friendly product mixed with skin-friendly product,"Imagine riding your bicycle on a smooth road and then suddenly there are bumps, potholes and mud. Sounds irritating right? 

Well, I have heard from my sister and friends, this is pretty much how a period is. The crampy aches, rashes, and annoying mess! But I keep wondering why would you force yourself to use a plastic infused pad that keeps hurting you? 

Why not use organic sanitary products?

Your health matters a lot!

Physical and mental both. Organic tampons, pads and other products wouldn‚Äôt just keep you comfortable and safe but it will also prevent skin diseases, rashes and irritation.

It will matter a lot in your daily lives, how? When you will be comfortable, your mood will be good, you can focus on your work and personal life efficiently and with full focus without worrying about- ‚ÄúIs there a stain‚Äù or ‚ÄúUgh, it‚Äôs so irritating‚Äù.

You can just be yourself.

Start prioritizing your health. 

Quality over quantity is what you should focus on, doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs food, apparels, accessories, people, and more importantly health.

I am in search of an eco-friendly and skin-safe elastic material suitable for wear.,"Greetings! I'm seeking an alternative to synthetic elastane (such as spandex or polyester) due to its non-biodegradable nature. Additionally, I aim to avoid any materials associated with petroleum feedstocks, although it seems that the majority of elastic products are connected to such feedstocks. As I intend to use this rubber in clothing, it is important for it to resist UV rays and maintain its elasticity over time, with good elastic recovery. While I've come across concerns about rubber's heat weakness, these typically refer to temperatures in the hundreds. Nevertheless, I would prefer a rubber with high heat resistance to ensure it does not melt while being worn by customers. It would be a bonus if the material is polar, meaning it does not attract oil from the skin and helps prevent body odor, although this requirement is not as crucial as the others. In summary, I am searching for a body-safe, biodegradable rubber or elastic material that is UV resistant, long-lasting, and derived from plant-based feedstocks or any eco-friendly source. Price is not a limiting factor, and I am willing to invest significantly in obtaining this material. If you know of any sources or individuals who can provide or create such a product, I would greatly appreciate being connected with them.",1,0,2023-07-10 19:42:09,PMvampit,EcoFriendly
"Is paraffin inherently less eco-friendly than alternatives? If so, what is the best alternative?","As I understand it paraffin is a waste product of oil refining. So using paraffin does not increase demand for oil. My only question is whether it is still worse than using other sources like beeswax or soy wax. It seems like if the wax is being removed from the oil anyway, and oil will be used for it's primary purposes of plastics, gasoline and other fuels, it seems like it might be less wasteful to use it rather than throw it away. But I don't know what the carbon costs for other materials might be.

Would be useful to see if anyone here has expert knowledge on what material to select when purchasing candles.

Note that these are candles being used for religious or cultural observances, not the scented variety. My candle consumption is relatively low. I know the best solution is usually ""don't buy at all/consume as little as possible"".",1,1,2023-05-07 18:32:11,notafuckingcakewalk,EcoFriendly

Eco-Friendly Small Business,"Hi, 

I'm looking to open a small niche e-commerce in the near future. Frankly, I know very little about going green beyond basic garbage recycling (which I've recently learned was mostly useless in the U.S. due to it's recycling infrastructure).

I wish to utilize as much eco-friendly packaging materials for my business, but don't have the knowledge or time understanding the chemical composition, optimal carbon footprint, etc. It seems many materials are sold as biodegradable or eco-friendly, but are just marketing tactics.   
I require packaging of various shapes and sizes, but are overall on the smaller end ranging from sample baggies to perhaps manilla envelope size at most. Many of this would be one time use disposable packaging, so I would rather minimize the plastic I use. 

Thus, I'd greatly appreciate any product/brands/things to look out for that you recommend would help me achieve this. Most of the products I have looked at were found on Amazon if you type things like ""biodegradeable packaging baggies"", but I'm skeptical. 

Thank you for your time and assistance!",3,3,2021-03-22 02:09:06,darkecho2788,EcoFriendly

Suggestions for UK eco-friendly shampoos?,"At the beginning of last year I started buying shampoo and conditioner from the refill store to reduce my plastic use, but it was super expensive and not great. I then went on to try and reduce the amount I washed my hair - followed so many online guides and just ended up with greasy hair after a year, so that wasn't for me.

After that I tried shampoo/conditioner bars, which also just did not agree with my hair. At this point my hair is fairly damaged from all the tangles, I think.

Anyway, I started using Faith in Nature shampoo and conditioner, which was great. Huge bottles to reduce plastic and you can send them back to be refilled in their closed recycling scheme.

However, over the past month my hair's started becoming super greasy after washes. It seems to be the conditioner but it gets so tangled without conditioner that I can't just go with shampoo, and the FIN brand shampoo seems to dry my hair out a lot (something I didn't notice when I could condition it). I stayed at my parents' recently and used Tresemme and it was incredible - I had clean, shiny hair again.

However, I still want to be eco friendly. Any suggestions of other eco brands like Faith in Nature I could try?

Tl;dr: Current eco brand shampoo/conditioner has started making hair really greasy. Can't use shampoo bars so looking for other eco-friendly brand suggestions in the UK",2,1,2021-06-08 12:10:18,SuzieSue32,EcoFriendly

I still have a full pack of non-eco-friendly ones and don't know what's the right thing to 'do' is?  


As I still have 1 and a half packs of puppy pads left that we aren't going to use, I was thinking of putting the pads up for sale with the nappy bags thrown in for free just to get rid of them (Nappy bags also fit the puppy pads easily ... dog poo bags are too small!)

Eco-friendly zip tie alternative.,"I work for a medical retrieval company. Everyday we check the contents of our drug/equipment packs and then secure them with an anti-tamper pulltie through the zips and write the date on the tag. 
We have other bags we check once a week.   We use  ~10-20 zip ties a day, though the company has multiple sites. 

I've been trying to think of an eco-friendly way of doing this.  The problem with reusable tags (i.e. velcro) is that we need to write a date on them, and when we're activated, we just rip the ties off in a hurry.  So, remembering to undo and keep the tie to reuse may be a problem.
I haven't found a biodegradable ziptie that include the label part.

1. Automatically save animals when you shop online - With this feature, before you make a purchase (any purchase) we will prompt you to buy the product through us. When you do that, we get money from affiliate and we will donate part of that money to organizations saving animals hurt by the climate change  
2. Eco-friendly product recommendations - With this feature, once you search for cleaning products, household products or beauty products, we will recommend you similar eco-friendly products - same as the first option, when you purchase through us, because we will get affiliate money, we will donate that to organizations saving animals

Once the kids are of age to understand the purpose behind these switches, you can slowly start explaining the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù.

You can check out [UPCICLO](https://upciclo.com/), it is an online marketplace for sustainable and eco-friendly products and they have a large variety of sustainable products in the kid‚Äôs category ranging from organic clothing to baby care to toys and games. Here are a few of my favourite picks:

Made in soft organic cotton, the playsuit is breathable and comfortable. The wooden buttons make it easy to put on, while the elastic on the paper bag style waist ensures a snug fit. Their price and care tags are printed with non-toxic ink on seed paper. Instead of throwing it in the trash, get your green thumbs out, plant it in the soil with your little one and watch your basil plant grow!

We created a directory to connect entrepreneurs with eco-friendly suppliers and manufacturers.,"Hey guys, so my friends and I found ourselves struggling to build our own eco-friendly product. When using Google, it was difficult and time-consuming to find sustainable suppliers or manufacturers, and we were bombarded with non-sustainable options. There‚Äôs no real search engine for finding them specifically.

So we decided to build [GreenHive](https://green-hive.com/), a platform that will connect eco-minded entrepreneurs with environment-oriented suppliers, manufacturers, and consultants. The goal is to make it easy for them to source the materials, products and services which meet their sustainability and business needs. Companies are grouped according to the industry they operate in. They will have profile pages on which they display their sustainability commitments, and their products & services. Here‚Äôs an [example company](https://green-hive.com/project/good-company-1/#sustainability-practices).

Our current platform is still a bit simplistic, but what we envision is that when an entrepreneur has an idea, he simply types it and will receive a curation of the eco-friendly suppliers that can potentially meet his needs. We have more complex, sustainability-focused ideas in mind, but at the moment we are keeping it simple. 

Since a lot of people feel that companies, large or small, need to be more environmentally responsible, we wanted to share this and are curious what you think! Do let us know of any feedback, ideas, or features you‚Äôd like to see.

Right now all I have featured are the sponges. I'll be posting the others within a few weeks as I'm still working the kinks out. 

      You see, luffas sold in stores or online are bleached to not only soften them but make them more visually appealing. I boil them instead to soften them for skin. I'm working out the timing and prices for them. 



     I would love if you checked them out. If you have questions feel free to ask.

Looking for Eco-friendly gifts for an exchange!,"Howdy!

&#x200B;

Let me begin by just saying I'm very new to being eco friendly. I'm just starting out and I know little to nothing about it. I signed up recently for an Eco-friendly exchange in order to learn more from people who might be wiser about it than I... but I'm running into a little snag

&#x200B;

I don't know the first thing about eco-friendly gifting, so I wouldn't know what to even look for! I will base my gifts off of what my giftee can tell me about themselves, as well as their wants, but what's a good starting point? What sort of things should I be looking for when going eco-friendly? Are there specific budget friendly brands I can turn to? What about homemade?

&#x200B;

Any help from someone who knows WAY more than I would be very appreciated!

&#x200B;

# UPDATE! My giftee is off to college in the fall and has asked for nothing more than a stainless steel bottle to take with them. What's a good brand I can look for and some other green gifts I can put along with itto help them out in college!( already considereing steel/silicone straws!)",5,10,2019-03-25 21:34:26,cervideaux,EcoFriendly

Recipes that are eco-friendly,"Is there a good resource for eco-friendly cooking?

I've heard recently that certain meats (mostly pork and beef) leave a huge carbon footprint because of the way they are raised/produced, and that this essentially corresponds with the size of the animal (e.g. chicken is the best choice, beef is the worst).

I am an omnivore (love fruits, veggies, meats, breads, pretty much everything tho I try to limit really processed foods) looking to reduce my carbon footprint by taking a hard look at the foods I eat, and meals my husband and I prepare. I'm not looking to cut out meat entirely or go vegan/vegetarian, and I like to include a lot of protein in my diet. I usually have meat at every meal except breakfast, although will have some vegetarian lunches at work, where they get a little creative and always price vegetarian options cheaper than meat options. 

Some non-meat sources I already try to incorporate are beans and quinoa, but I'm running out of ideas, the list of eco-friendly, high protein foods I use is very short, and a go-to resource for some new options would help me be a lot more successful!",5,3,2019-04-07 20:56:07,bebe_bird,EcoFriendly

"Do you know of any warm but sleek jackets as eco-friendly and affordable as possible? If so, please share!","Hello! 

I am going on a trip to Iceland this winter and am in need of a good jacket. I don't like heavy or thick jackets so something that looks slim while providing as much heat as possible would be ideal. 

I also try to be eco-friendly. Usually this would mean I would look for something synthetic but now I'm realizing how bad plastics and polyester are for the environment so I'm thinking I should buy something using actual animal parts because they'll actually degrade back into nature instead of just breaking down into micro-plastics that we don't fully understand the repercussions of yet.

I'm also relatively low on funds so I can't afford something too expensive.  

I know I'll never find a jacket that fully meets all my criteria, I'm just looking for something that hits some of them. Any and all advice would be appreciated. 

Thank you so much, reddit!",9,22,2022-08-16 02:27:40,ananonomous,BuyItForLife

Stainless Steel Pros: durable, easy to clean, dishwasher safe.
Stainless Steel Cons: scratches non-stick surfaces; conducts heat, which can lead to burns.

Silicone Pros: flexible and gentle on cookware; non-porous, doesn't absorb flavors or odors.
Silicone Cons: heat resistant, but still burns; degrades over time and may release chemicals.

Wood Pros: doesn't conduct heat, so it prevents burns; biodegradable.
Wood Cons: absorbs flavors and odors; prone to cracking; easier bacteria growth.

Bamboo Pros: more resistant to bacteria and water damage than wood; lightweight; strong; eco-friendly.
Bamboo Cons: absorbs flavors and odors; requires hand washing and proper care to last.

Screen door for doggie passthrough while keeping out bugs,"I've bought the screen door in the image four times in the last 2 years. It's a brilliant product - the magnets open for the dogs to go outside, and then automatically close behind them. And the installation is fairly easy. It's much better than having a normal sliding screen door, which would also be much harder and more expensive to replace after damage. This thing is fairly inexpensive, and if I have to pay ~$25 2x/year for the convenience of letting the dogs go in and out without letting in bugs, then so be it.

The problem is, these screens aren't durable at all, at least not against dogs, who are the intended beneficiaries of the product. Dog's nails scratch holes in the base of the screen and eventually the holes are so egregious that the dog will get a paw stuck in it and then drag the whole screen off the velcro. And it hurts my conscience to keep trashing these things so frequently, because they're surely not any type of biodegradable.

Requesting a suggestion for a more durable version of this, or a more eco-friendly version, or some other ""let dogs in and out without letting in bugs"" solution. Preferably not a doggie door because I don't think I could convince my parents to go for that, unless it's as easy and non-destructive to install as this thing.",5,12,2023-03-02 15:47:02,mtzvhmltng,BuyItForLife

Clothing Fabric Help Guide (by me),"Hi BIFL friends!

I‚Äôve seen numerous questions in comments about fabrics and clothing so I thought I‚Äôd throw together a little guide for our shared interests. A lot of this information is from my experience as a sewer, knitter, crocheter, and yarn spinner. I‚Äôve been working with fabrics and fiber since I was little. I would love for others to add on!

Edit: Read the comments there is some great stuff there too! Thanks everyone who added!

**Fiber: Wool (sheep)**

Pros: Long-lasting, eco-friendly, warm when wet, elastic

Cons: Felting, shrinking

Care notes: Do not ever put wool in the dryer or a hot washing machine unless the instructions explicitly state ‚Äúsuperwash‚Äù or ‚Äúdry on low heat.‚Äù It will shrink and you will have a sweater for your dog instead of yourself. ‚ÄúDarning‚Äù is the term for repairing a wool knit that has been damaged. If you invest hard in wool, it‚Äôs a skill worth learning and can be done with any needle and thread.

Recommendations: You know those old professor sweaters, the brown wool sweater with the leather elbow patches? Basically the ideal clothing item. If you want wool to be BIFL, you need reinforcement on high-wear areas, otherwise the fabric will felt and shrink at those spots (ex: elbows of sweaters, heels of socks).

**Fiber: Alpaca, Mohair, Cashmere and other luxury animal fibers**

Other animal fibers are similar to wool in almost every way, so the notes above apply here too. Some animal fibers such as alpaca and rabbit do not stretch as much as sheep‚Äôs wool, so you will see them blended with other fibers more often. For longer life, get one of these delicate animal fibers blended with sheep‚Äôs wool.

**Fiber: Cotton, Linen**

Pros: Natural/organic, sturdy

Cons: Color does not hold well, tends to shrink, not stretchy at all

Care notes: To prevent cotton material from shrinking, you want to put it in the dryer at low heat, and get it out before it is entirely dry. Cotton wrinkles. If you need to iron, check your blend ‚Äì a cotton/poly blend will need a higher temperature.

Recommendations: Cotton fades. Buy any color but black for longest survivability. Buy a size up to allow for shrinking. Look for heavier fibers to increase the longevity of your items ‚Äì if you can‚Äôt see the individual threads, the item will probably wear through fairly quickly. There‚Äôs a reason cotton fabric is the go-to for denim! It lasts, but fades.

**Fiber: Spandex and Lycra**

Pros: Stretchy

Cons: Limited lifespan

Care notes: Ideally, do not dry in the dryer. If you have to, keep it short and low temperature. Lycra dries very fast so it needs less time to dry than other fabrics. Spandex depends on what it is blended with.

Recommendations: Spandex is the part that will fail first in your stretchy garments. For BIFL, avoid Spandex. Realistically, expect that these are disposable items that will need to be replaced regularly. Sorry, nothing to be done about it.

**Fiber: Polyester, Acrylic**

Pros: Durable, cheap, dyes vibrantly, blends well with other fabrics

Cons: Bad for the environment (both the production and the decay of polyester increase the quantity of microplastics in water systems), dries slow and cold (if you sweat or get wet in polyester, you will be wet for awhile)

Care notes: Polyester doesn‚Äôt care about anything (including ironing). If you have a blend, care for the product based on the other fibers in the blend.

Recommendations: Very difficult to avoid. Blends recommended. Almost all fast fashion is polyester-based. Knitted polyester items will generally fail at the seams first, so check at the seams before investing in a pricey item.

**Fiber: Nylon**

Pros: Does not shrink, dries quickly

Cons: Easily damaged by heat, actually quite rare, tends to pill

Care notes: Damaged with high temperatures but it dries very fast so just let it air-dry

Recommendations: Nylon is a personal favorite of mine for hot weather and workout gear. It has largely been replaced with Polyester so you might have better luck finding it at thrift stores.

"[BIFL request] Vintage style, leather looking or canvas messenger bag.","I see that people request messenger bags a lot here, the last two times it hit my front page I saved them and after looking through those two threads, I didn't quite see what I was looking for, as the OP's had different needs and specifications, so I thought I'd go ahead and post a thread a bit more specific to my own needs and interests.

I would like the bag to be a vintage style, made out of leather, or at least leather looking, I also wouldn't mind something made of canvas. I have no problem with faux leather. In fact I'm legitimately considering going vegan, so perhaps in the future I may appreciate a bag that's not made out of actual leather more, but given the number of products boasting ‚Äúgenuine leather‚Äù I wonder if faux is more expensive? I wouldn't think so, but this makes me question that.

I don't need a briefcase handle, but I would like the bag to hold its shape or stand on its own (a feature that I'm willing to sacrifice if need be), and I'd need to be able to wear it while riding my bike. 

I've noticed when looking into messenger bags, many are shaped like [this](http://www.chromeindustries.com/us/en/limited-edition-mini-metro-messenger-bag) which seems odd to me, almost like the flap is disproportionate in size, and it's not necessarily a look that appeals to me, I would prefer something shaped more like [this](http://www.amazon.com/17-3-Inch-Eco-Friendly-Canvas-Messenger-Green/dp/B0029L7N9E/ref=pd_sbs_198_1?ie=UTF8&dpID=51YzcnLMSpL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL200_SR160%2C200_&refRID=0XQACEJT22ZETWP3WBJE) or [this](http://www.satchel-page.com/products/mailbag). But I'm curious, is there a functional reason for the shape? Is there a reason that I should look more into the first style/shape rather than the style I'm hoping for?

The bag needs to hold:

- my 15.6 inch laptop.

- one or preferably two textbooks. (I know that's a lot.)

- A file organizor like [this](http://www.staples.com/Pendaflex-Professional-Expanding-Organizer-Blue-Letter-6-Each-52670/product_PFX52670?cid=PS:GooglePLAs:PFX52670&ci_src=17588969&ci_sku=PFX52670&KPID=PFX52670&gclid=CP2gnujVtMoCFVKEfgodf1MHUw)

- a regular reading book

- pens, hylighters, pensils

- notebooks

- folders

and various cords

-  phone charger

-  laptop charger

pretty much just anything that I would need for school. I would like the bag to be versatile, so that while its main purpose is for school, I could take it with me when I travel, my family is huge into Disneyland so maybe something that I can take into the parks, hold a change of clothes if I think I'll need it, or just pretty much take with me anywhere that I'd need my laptop and hold whatever accompanying items I happen to have at the time.

Looking at reviews for many leather bags on Amazon, there seem to be three pretty common complaints, that either the leather stinks and needs to be aired out, the surface is sticky with residue, and or it bleeds dye and ruins clothes.

As far as price goes, I want something that meets these qualification, if it comes down to it, I would probably be willing to sacrifice the style for a product that is going to be a little better, last a little longer, and be a little cheaper. I don't have a lot of money to spend, but I am willing to save up for it if I'm going to love it in the long run. Ideally though, I would like a relatively cheap product.

TL;DR: cheap-ish or godlike for the price, leather looking or canvas bag, that can protect a laptop and hold a ton of shit.",16,19,2016-01-19 01:08:51,Kate925,BuyItForLife
Did a Blog post about the kinds/qualities/misconceptions regarding Veg-tanned leather.,"Hello again BifL-ers.  I've written up another [Blog post](https://nstarleather.wordpress.com/2017/11/22/vegetable-tanned-leather-much-more-variety-than-you-think/) this time about veg-tan leather.  I've you'd been on this sub for a while you may remember my posts about Genuine, Top Grain, and Full grain.  Although I do run a leather company but the the goal here is educate (not sell) and kill some misconceptions spread by companies that use specific types of leather.  The BIFL connection here is that many companies claim that veg-tan has superior durability compared to other leathers and some other qualities people look for in lasting products.  While veg-tan can be great, there's a lot of hyperbole in many of the articles about it.  This post is to cut through the marketing and show some of the variations in this type of leather. 

Per r/buyitforlife rules I'm posting the text of the article below along with [this imgur gallery](https://imgur.com/a/ncWan) with pictures from the post.
Here's the better formatted [post](https://nstarleather.wordpress.com/2017/11/22/vegetable-tanned-leather-much-more-variety-than-you-think/) but since I use the free version of wordpress, there are ads.

###""Vegetable Tanned Leather: Much more variety than you think.""



If you‚Äôre like most people, when you hear the words ‚Äúvegetable tanned leather‚Äù, a specific picture pops into your mind (unless you‚Äôre like the confused/disappointed people who call me every couple months who read ‚Äúveg-tan leather‚Äù as ‚Äúvegan leather‚Äù).  Most people I talk to, even many who work with leather, think that veg-tan is that natural colored leather that‚Äôs been made popular in the last 5-10 years, by tons of artisan leatherworkers.  This leather known for it‚Äôs natural look and ability to acquire a patina quickly and easily.  While this kind of veg-tan (natural) is great (especially for tooling, hand-dying and wet- molding), it‚Äôs just one of many types of leather that fall into the much bigger ‚Äúveg-tan category‚Äù.  There‚Äôs also a lot is ‚Äúfluff‚Äù and misinformation out there about Veg-tan‚Äôs qualities and benefits,  and, just like with Full Grain, these exaggerations and myths come mainly from people marketing products they make from veg-tan. It‚Äôs easy to find articles exaggerating or skewing the advantages of Veg-tan leather vs Chrome-tan leather, so towards the end of this post we‚Äôll bust some straight-up myths and add some nuance to the other claims made about vegetable tanned leather.

 

##General Info: What makes Veg-Tan different?

Vegetable tanned leather is leather that is tanned using tannins and other ingredients found in different vegetable matter, such as tree bark prepared in bark mills, wood, leaves, fruits, and roots.  Now, this doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre dumping a bunch of bark into vats with the leather, most tanneries use extracts purchased in bulk.  This is in contrast with the other major industrial method of tanning leather, chrome tanning, which uses chromium salts.

Vegetable tanned leather makes up a much smaller percentage of leather produced than chrome-tan and is generally considered a somewhat ‚Äúmore natural‚Äù product but, like everything produced on an industrial scale, ‚Äúmore natural‚Äù is relative.  One claim that does hold true with veg-tan is that it does also take significantly longer to produce (months vs days) that chrome-tanned leather.

##The many variations of veg-tan:


##The OG: Natural Veg-Tan

You‚Äôll find lots of companies making wallets to belts and everything in between out of natural veg.  There‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with that; I‚Äôve made quite a few natural veg-tan wallets as custom requests and a few bulk orders for wholesale customers.  However, leaving this type of leather ‚Äúnatural‚Äù is a fairly recent trend.  I‚Äôve been going to craft shows  looking at and selling leather goods since I was less than a year old, and can‚Äôt remember ever seeing the preponderance of natural veg-tan that you see nowadays from big-name makers and artisan brands.  This is because, to put it simply, natural veg-tan is made to be further treated/finished in some way.  At the very least, traditional makers would oil the the leather to darken it up and condition it.    The reason that natural veg develops a ‚Äúpatina‚Äù so much more noticeably and quickly than other leathers is because natural veg-tan is made to absorb water for tooling and also to absorb leather dye to further finish it.  When it darkens because of use, you‚Äôre literally dying it slowly with your own natural oils and dirt.

##Natural Veg-Tan: Meant to be tooled

Natural vegetable tanned leather is ideal if you want to make a tooled belt or wet-mold it to make a perfectly fitting holster.  It‚Äôs also the go-to for traditional saddle making.   For many years we‚Äôve offered hand-dyed embossed wallet in veg-tan that we emboss and finish ourselves: (pictures in the [gallery](https://imgur.com/gallery/ncWan)


##Other Vegetable Tanned Leathers:

Natural Vegetable tanned may be what comes to mind when you think veg-tan, but you have probably heard the names of many other veg-tan leathers without even realizing it.  These are just a few of the many veg-tan leathers available besides the classic natural veg-tan:

#English Bridle Leather:

Wickett & Craig and Herman Oak in USA and Sedgwick in England are the big names in this English Bridle Leather ( and vegetable tanned leather, in general: I highly recommend their check their websites for more detailed info).

English Bridle is Vegetable tanned leather that‚Äôs been drum dyed and ‚Äúhot stuffed‚Äù (impregnated with oils and waxes) to give it a great look and slightly waxy feel.  You see this leather a lot in thicker applications like belts, knife sheaths and horse tack, but a full range of thickness can be purchased from 2oz and up, so wallets and other small goods are also common.

Bridle leather can‚Äôt be cased and tooled like natural veg-tan, but it can be printed with just pressure (unlike most chrome-tan, which usually requires heat).

#Horween Veg-Tan:

Horween Tannery in Chicago has at least 7 types of straight vegetable tanned leathers on their full tannage list (including shell Cordovan).  I‚Äôve personally had the chance to work with Essex, Dublin, and Rockford.  These leathers are great to work with and beautiful, but truth be told, they look and behave much like Horween‚Äôs chrome-tanned leathers.

#European Veg-tan:

 
A while ago, my wife bought a the small leather bag  pictured above made in Florence Italy (it had a big ‚ÄúGenuine Leather‚Äù tag), but the little information card included about the company that made it, went into detail about how it was made from full grain Italian vegetable-tanned leather.  Since then, I‚Äôve been noticing more and more examples of European vegetable tanned leathers and products made from them.  Many of them in ‚Äúsofter‚Äù applications (purses, small bags, garments, etc) than you‚Äôd see for other veg-tan leathers like bridle leather and natural veg-tan.  The leathers look and feel great, but visibly there isn‚Äôt much difference in the look and feel between these leathers of other non-veg-tan garment weight leathers I‚Äôve seen.   Buttero is a well know brand of Italian veg-tan.

##Common Myths and Exaggerations and Partial truths:

There are a lot of claims about the superiority of veg-tan vs chrome-tan; most have a grain of truth or are based on the qualities of the some of the veg-tan leathers that are most commonly found, but many of the articles out there also smell of marketing spin.  I‚Äôve found that the best, most objective information can be found on the websites of the tanneries that produce these leathers, whereas there‚Äôs a lot more spin from companies who are selling the products.

 

Lets add some nuance to the common myths about veg-tan:


#Veg-tan is thicker:

I‚Äôve seen this come up several times in articles about veg-tan (just like it did with full grain), and I don‚Äôt really understand where exactly where this idea comes from. Veg-tan, just like any other leather, it can be split to any thickness (Wickett & Craig offers from 2oz-14oz). While it‚Äôs true that you tend to see chrome-tan more often in thinner applications (soft bags, garments, and upholstery) and veg-tan more in thicker products (things like belts and holsters), there‚Äôs nothing about the tanning method itself that would make the leather inherently thicker.


#Veg-tan doesn‚Äôt come in bright colors:

While it‚Äôs true that the big name veg-tan tanneries offer mostly earth-tones as their ‚Äústock‚Äù colors, once again, nothing about vegetable tanning makes bright colors impossible.  I‚Äôve gotten my hands on Wickett & Craig bridle leather in bright blue, chili-pepper red, spruce green and cool grey.  I‚Äôve also bought Horween Essex and Rockford in lollipop red, regatta blue, periwinkle and bold orange. Yes it‚Äôs less common that, say, black brown and tan, but there are lots of bright veg-tan options out there.


#Veg-Tan is more breathable:

As I covered in my full grain article, a leather‚Äôs breathability doesn‚Äôt have much to do with the type of leather; it has to do with how it‚Äôs finished.  I feel like calling any leather ‚Äúbreathable‚Äù is kind of inaccurate:  Leather, in general, isn‚Äôt a material that allows a lot of air to pass through, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs the best material for biker jackets.  Yes, many veg-tan leathers are finished ‚Äúlightly‚Äù so, in theory, they‚Äôd have marginally more breathability when compared to some heavily finished chrome-tan leathers, however heavily waxed/oiled veg-tan leathers like those used in horse tack or waterproofed goods wouldn‚Äôt breath much at all.

#Veg-tan has more ‚ÄúLife:‚Äú

This is one of those kinda silly abstract things that sounds nice when describing veg-tan, so we can‚Äôt be sure what the articles are actually talking about.   I suppose maybe they mean that veg-tan leather  has a more natural feel?   If you were to hand two pieces of leather to someone who claims veg-tan has more life, one chrome-tan with a minimal finish in an earth-tone color and the other a veg-tan in a bright color with a glossy finish, I‚Äôd expect they‚Äôd say the first had more ‚Äúlife.‚Äù  How ‚Äúnatural‚Äù a leather feels is a very subjective thing and really won‚Äôt be effected much by the way the leather is tanned.


#Only veg-tan will get a patina:

Another way to describe ‚Äúpatina‚Äù is a desireable layer of dirt and oil your leather item has acquired over time with use.  With time this layer will develop on almost any leather (except PU coated leathers).  It will develop much more quickly and much more noticeably on leathers with a minimal or no finish coat (which is why you see it mentioned a lot when referring to products made from natural veg-tan).  If you want the a leather that will get ‚Äúmaximum patina‚Äù look for a white suede or nubuck, because they will suck up oil and stains like a sponge.  If you want less patina, go for a dark color leather with a glossy finish. Whether you buy chrome or veg won‚Äôt make the difference.



#Veg-tan is ‚Äúorganic‚Äù: It‚Äôs made with barks, branches, and leaves:

A family member once asked me if we had any ‚Äúorganic ‚Äù leather, and while some sites use this term when talking about veg-tan, I don‚Äôt feel you can call any commercially produced leather ‚Äúorganic.‚Äù  Leather tanning is a chemical process, and while the ‚Äútanning‚Äù part of the veg-tan process does come from natural sources (plant extracts), they also use salt, lime, and all sorts of other chemicals in the dying and finishing process.  If you want the most natural leather possible, go for natural veg or better yet, brain tanned leather.


#Veg-tan is more durable can last an entire lifetime and is bio-degradable when it ceases to be used/maintained:

You‚Äôll see this one a lot, but you can‚Äôt have both: it‚Äôs impossible to claim that veg-tan lasts longer and is more durable than chrome-tan while, at the same time, claiming that it breaks down more easily in the environment.  Those two things are diametrically opposed.



In reality, both veg-tan and chrome-tan will last a comparably long time if properly maintained.  Natural veg-tan will tend to dry out and crack more easily if not maintained on a regular basis, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it will quickly disappear in the environment.  As far leather being biodegradable goes, you can go to a museum and find very old leather items (hundreds or thousands of years old) these artifacts pre-date chrome-tanning by hundreds of years; so, while conditions have a lot to do with a material‚Äôs breakdown, any type of leather will take a long time to be reabsorbed into the environment.  Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre doing the environment a huge favor buying one type of leather over another.


#‚ÄúMuch Better‚Äù for the environment:

We touched on this on the above point, but typing ‚ÄúWhat is vegetable tanned leather?‚Äù into a search engine can give some really strongly worded results when talking about the environment impact of veg-tan vs chrome-tanned leather;  the words ‚Äúharmful to the environment‚Äù gets used when talking about chrome-tan and ‚Äúgood for the environment‚Äù ‚Äúeco-friendly‚Äù and the like, when talking about veg-tan.  Just reading some of these articles, you‚Äôd think the skin falls right off the cow‚Äôs body when it dies peacefully of old age, autumn leaves fall on top, and veg-tan is harvested the following spring‚Ä¶


While, yes, there have been some horribly bad environmental impacts in countries in the developing world due to chrome leather tanneries, the fact of the matter is that making leather is a chemical process that preserves something that would normally rot in a natural environment.  This means that tanning agents are not environmentally neutral.  Whether those chemicals come from Chromium Salt,  Vegetable Tannins, or Brains (yes you can use brains to tan leather), when done on a large scale, the byproducts should be disposed of in the most environmentally responsible way possible.    So, yes, while there is some consensus that the agents used in vegetable tanning are slightly less harmful to the environment, Large-scale veg-tan tanneries do not have a pipe going out the back that dumps the leftover tanning solutions into a nearby creek or river (or at least I hope they don‚Äôt).  Herman Oak (one of the big veg-tan tanneries), describes on their webpage how they file 11 reports per year and keep 130 logs regarding the environmental laws they must comply with.



On a related side-note: while the tanneries who make vegetable tanned leather do speak very highly of their veg-tan product, they don‚Äôt slant towards hyperbole as much as many sellers of finished veg-tan leather goods.  Herman Oak, for example, has a [great page](http://www.hermannoakleather.com/resources-and-events/tanning-process) where they show the differences in the veg-tan and chrome-tan process without exaggerating the differences.  They also have  a [detailed page where they talk about their environmental impact](http://www.hermannoakleather.com/about/environmental), and go on to explain how many things are toxic in high concentrations, including things that people would consider ‚Äúorganic‚Äù, like the agents used to make veg-tan leather.



Personally, I feel that it‚Äôs much more important to buy leather from tanneries with responsible environmental practices and working conditions, regardless of the tanning processes.  It‚Äôs very possible that buying a chrome-tanned leather from a country or region of the world with stricter environmental laws (like USA or the EU) is more likely to have less environmental impact than buying veg-tan from an area of the world with lower environmental standards and poor working conditions.   If you do want to find fully vegetable tanned leathers sourced from the USA look to Herman Oak, Wickett & Craig, and the specific vegetable tannages from Horween.



Another thing we do here at our company to lessen our environmental impact is make an effort to use as much of our leather as possible (we send very little scrap leather to the dump). We also try to purchase and use scrap from other factories to make many of our products ([see my article on where I get my leather for details on how we use scrap](https://nstarleather.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/hey-man-where-do-you-get-your-leather/).)


So that‚Äôs vegetable tanned leather!  If you want a more natural look and feel, go for natural veg-tan.  If you‚Äôre concerned about your environmental impact, go for a natural veg-tan sourced from a tannery in a country with a good environmental reputation.  Enjoy the look smell and feel of leather.",15,2,2017-11-23 15:08:43,nstarleather,BuyItForLife

My doctor took me off the combined pill immediately due to the migraines and put me on a progesterone-only pill, which is working fine except for light spotting in between my periods. The past month I think I had some spotting every single day.

I resisted going back to pads/pantyliners until now because I‚Äôm stubborn like that but wearing a cup every single day is uncomfortable, so I often end up not wearing anything besides plain old underwear.

The myth of today's eco-friendly fabrics,"**The environmental impact of cotton**

Everything from land to water and air is affected by the highly intensive production of cotton. A process that could be limited by choosing eco-friendly alternatives such as Eucalyptus instead, which requires way fewer resources to be produced. Here‚Äôs how unsustainable cotton is in comparison:

**Producing each kilogram of cotton requires 20,000 liters of water** \- Eucalyptus sheets only require up to 155 gallons of water per pound. Meaning that this switch could save 1035 days of drinking water.

**Cotton‚Äôs production makes up 11% of pesticide use and 16% of insecticide use at a global level** \- The production of Eucalyptus requires no pesticide as they are naturally insect repellent. By choosing Eucalyptus, you save 352sq ft of land farmed without pesticides.¬†

[Is Bamboo the solution?](https://preview.redd.it/3eayaasjh7i81.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ff97b3c72cefe0ba9bc1ccc0a95f48c5d22089a)

For those who have become aware of the unsustainability of cotton before, bamboo was hailed as the perfect solution to save the environment. However, is your bamboo bedding really made of bamboo?

Now, here‚Äôs the thing - processing Bamboo to make it into fabric can happen in two ways. One, is by using the chemical process we outlined above, which would leave the fabric with no actual trace of Bamboo.

The other follows a mechanical process where the bamboo is crushed and then natural enzymes are applied to break down the cell walls. This creates a mass that can then be mechanically combed and spun into yarn. This process is actually sustainable but unfortunately also more expensive and time-consuming.

As such, many fabrics that claim to be ‚Äòmade from bamboo‚Äô are in fact ‚Äòmade with viscose from bamboo‚Äô!

Americans throw away 25% extra trash between Thanksgiving and New Year‚Äôs ‚Äî about a million extra tons of garbage each week. These are some tips we can use to make the holidays more eco-friendly üòÑ,"Tips to cut back on plastic and other waste during the holidays:

* **Use real or compostable table settings instead of plastics**\-- if you‚Äôre short on table settings, try a sharing economy platform like [stuff4hire.com](https://stuff4hire.com)*,* where you can **rent out glasses, plates, silverware, etc. in advance online and then return the dishes afterward.**
* Have **recyclable to-go containers** handy for guests to take leftovers home üòã
* **Gift experiences instead of ""stuff""**. A great example of an experience gift would be concert or amusement park tickets, as well as gift cards that can be credited towards a museum tour, a professional cooking class, or even an online course.
* Go **paperless for holiday card**s as they generally get trashed after the holidays anyway! There are numerous companies offering deluxe electronic cards, such as [Paperless Post](https://PaperlessPost.com) & [Green Envelope](https://GreenEnvelope.com) 
* Consider familiarizing yourself with local compost centers ahead of time, so food waste doesn‚Äôt end up in the landfill. 

Since wrapping paper and ribbon are top on the list of wasteful holiday traditions, I suggest **getting creative with gift wrapping**! Homemade, repurposed gift wrap can look even better than store-bought wrapping paper. 

* Unused maps, magazines, or comics could double as wrapping paper. **You could also make your own wrapping paper with the help of markers or paint and extra papers you have around the house!**
* In place of ribbon, you could use fresh greenery instead of store-bought bows :) IDK about you, but I think it would be awesome to receive a gift this way. So unique!  

*Every year, Americans discard an estimated 38,000 miles of ribbon, enough to wrap around the planet with some left over to tie a bow, according to NEEF.*

Idea for an economic and eco-friendly solution to pet poop disposal.,"I recently adopted a cat and although I have been recycling grocery produce bags as poop bags, I have realized how wasteful single use poop bags really are.

Here‚Äôs what I believe could be a low cost, sanitary, and eco friendly solution to pet poop management:

1) Set up an outdoor bucket with a tight fitting lid, lined with a plastic garbage bag.

2) Use paper bags to transport litter to outdoor bucket.

3) Dispose of poop collection once full.

Zero-waste / Eco-friendly baby gift ideas?,"My uncle and aunt are expecting twin boys in May. I‚Äôd like to give them something thoughtful and practical, and something that would inspire them to be a little less wasteful when it comes to taking care of two babies. 

I know diapers and wipes are the main source of waste, but I can‚Äôt dictate if they are going to use cloth diapers and cloth wipes (and they probably won‚Äôt as being eco-friendly isn‚Äôt at the top of their priorities, poo is still disgusting, and they will have to do double the work). Also, cloth diapers are not really suitable for new born babies who would grow out of them really quickly anyways. 

However, if there is something that would actually lessen their burden and reduce their waste, or even a less wasteful swap that only require the same work, it would make a perfect gift. 

I personally started my journey to zero waste after switching to a menstrual cup for comfort and convenience, not necessarily for environmental reasons. And got ‚Äúhooked‚Äù to the idea of reducing my waste as a by product. Maybe there is something similar for new parents? 

Another thing is I live in Australia while they are all the way over in Canada. So I‚Äôd have to think about shipping and stuff. I can order something online from North America and have them ship straight to their address (any chance I could get something second hand that way?)...

Eco-Friendly Small Business,"Hi, 

I'm looking to open a small niche e-commerce in the near future. Frankly, I know very little about going green beyond basic garbage recycling (which I've recently learned was mostly useless in the U.S. due to it's recycling infrastructure).

I wish to utilize as much eco-friendly packaging materials for my business, but don't have the knowledge or time understanding the chemical composition, optimal carbon footprint, etc. It seems many materials are sold as biodegradable or eco-friendly, but are just marketing tactics.   
I require packaging of various shapes and sizes, but are overall on the smaller end ranging from sample baggies to perhaps manilla envelope size at most. Many of this would be one time use disposable packaging, so I would rather minimize the plastic I use. 

Thus, I'd greatly appreciate any product/brands/things to look out for that you recommend would help me achieve this. Most of the products I have looked at were found on Amazon if you type things like ""biodegradeable packaging baggies"", but I'm skeptical.

"Making cat toys out of scrap fabric, but I've run out of ""stuffing"" any suggestions on an eco-friendly stuffing?","I foster and help with a cat foster group that is pretty much always struggling for funding. 

I sew as a hobby and for cosplay so over time I have accumulated a large amount of scrap fabric. 

Trying to be as zero-waste as possible, I keep every scrap of fabric, large or small. 

I started making cat toys filled with catnip out of the scraps to sell at farmers' markets to raise money for the group. 

In addition to the catnip I would use the scraps of fabric that were too small to make a toy out of to fill the rest of it out. 

Unfortunately (or fortunately), I have run out of small scraps. I don't want to buy stuffing because:   
A. That's not really zero waste.  
B. ALL of the proceeds go to the foster group. I am taking none of the profit for myself, so I want to try and keep my overhead cost as low as possible. 

I suppose I could cut some of the larger scrap pieces, but then I feel like I am on ""borrowed time"" by taking from one pile to fill the other.

Sharing Eco-friendly stuff!! (Also waiting for your recommendation),"With the new year coming up, I took some time to start a list of stuff regarding zero/low-waste. I'm not saying there are perfect for everyone, but I think it is good for me, and if you have eco-friendly products to recommend, WELCOME!!! I need it!! As it‚Äôs hard to find good but economical products, as in my opinion, eco-friendly products are expensive...or they are less useful than those traditional products, like laundry sheets, laundry eggs and etc.

&#x200B;

1. Coconut oil. That‚Äôs the product I really fell in love with last year!! Actually, I just use it to cook firstly(TBH it takes good and it‚Äôs low-fat and healthy). And then, I scrolled through some cool posts which are talking about different usage of coconut oil, which really surprise me. Right now, I will use it as body lotion, shaving cream(But I would not apply it to my hair.. It's bad)! I can't say it's zero waste but at least they're good, cheap, and eco-friendly.

&#x200B;

2. Plastic-free razors. If you are a person that shaves, gong away from plastic razors that a lot of times can't even be recycled. A lot of them end up in our oceans. The Environmental Protection Agency once estimated 2 billion razors and refill bladers get tossed out in the U.S each year. So A plastic-free razors must be a more sustainable option.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3. pela case. I discard plastic or silicone phone case for a long time. pela case is a composable phone case and it's made from plants. As we all know, plastic stuff finally would end up in the ocean or in the land. Although they as a little bit expensive compared with plastic phone cases, I would like to pay for them as they can last for a long time. (Of course, sososo welcomes you to recommend me some new eco-friendly brands!)

&#x200B;

4. Laundry sheets. Actually, I used different kinds of laundry sheets, like Tru earth, Earth Breeze, Droops and etc. TBH I think they can't work as great as traditional laundry detergent or laundry powder(But I would absolutely not recommend laundry powder as they contain a lot of harmful ingredients, like phosphorus, that will pollute water and land ). For me, I think the laundry sheets are enough for me(At least they are not bad). I will keep using it.

&#x200B;

5.MOREi Floor Cleaning sheets. Honestly, that's an innovative¬†product I used this year as it's a new brand¬†I guess. (I was so happy that more and more companies come up with creative solutions to reduce waste)And why I know about that..I brush their ads on Instagram and I can't reject any eco-friendly brand. Especially it's similar to the laundry sheets. From my own perspective, I think it works well, except for some floor gaps that contain really hard dirt, but most of the time it works well and it's easy to use.

Because I think most brands that are eco-friendly are highly expensive and the world only benefits from it because the products are made ""eco-aware"" but are not designed by consuming or using the product to relieve environment. 

By far I only found ""dryer balls"", does anybody know some other products I can buy?

Eco-Friendly Canadian Cleaning Product Recommendations,"Hey guys, I'm looking to switch to cleaning products that come in the form of pressed tabs or concentrate in either biodegradable or dissolvable pods that you would then add water to in a reusable vessel.

I am studying at the univestity in a big city. After moving here, i decided to become more eco:  I started collecting paper, plastic bottles and glass separately. I also started to consume less - I began to spend more wisely on clothes and always take water in my bottle.

Nevertheless i have some problems with buying products and things in the store. In my city it's very hard to find really eco-friendly brands, trying to help the environment

I'd really like to find compostable/biodegradable mailers because I have a feeling most people won't go through the trouble of recycling the poly mailer and it will just end up in the landfill.  But I also want to make sure the mailer is durable enough for transit.

Are toothbrushes with refillable heads more eco-friendly than bamboo toothbrushes?,I was just thinking about this while I was brushing my teeth for the night. Why should we buy a bamboo toothbrush and snap off the head to throw away and be left with a lone handle that has to be composted? Technically nothing is wrong with the handle.

Then you can continue to use the handle for as long as you can. The refillable heads cost the same amount as a bamboo toothbrush would. And the bamboo toothbrush uses plastic bristles anyway.

Eco-Friendly Minimalist in a Capitalistic Hellhole [ADVICE NEEDED],"How do other eco-minded folk stomach the thought of working forty hours a week until retirement at various capitalistic companies that do not share their values or ethics? I have found that most companies that I have worked at or considered applying to, do not actually stick to their ""green values"" in a way that really matters. This green-washing makes me wary to even apply to jobs because I know that I can't afford to have a bunch of 4 month long jobs on my resume, and when they ask, most companies do not want to hear ""I left my last job because they were environmentally terrible, despite their sustainability intiative press releases"" during a job interview. I have found that I am miserable in most retail and marketing positions, because I believe that a green future inherently requires less mindless societal consumption. The thought of pushing products that I view as unnecessary, wasteful, or polluting makes me sick in my soul, but that is most of the companies I have seen in America. I also just can't get past the thought of all that unnecessary plastic packaging that comes with manufacturing and shipping. For health reasons, I would have trouble doing hard labor in the outdoors at an organic, sustainable farm for example.

Many companies that are making important scientific advancements in the field of eco-science have a very high bar of entry and Im not particularly passionate about having a science based career, I already have my degree in another field, and Im 22 which may be too old for an entire career rewrite. I just want to work somewhere that shares my eco-minded ethics, treats their employees decently (fair pay, safe conditions, good work/life balance) and uses my skills (Arts Administration, Digital Marketing, and Technical Theatre). I've often dreamed of creating/running an eco-friendly art coalition that featured work by zero waste artists, provided resources to the public on how to create eco-friendly artwork, sold eco-friendly supplies, and offered eco-consulting for other art businesses such as theatre, which is what I got my degree in. It's hard for me to even work in my field of technical theatre and arts administration because of the inherently wasteful nature of so much of theatre.

Do any of you have any suggestions on what to do? I'm at a loss. If you have good companies to recommend or good life advice, I am absolutely all ears.",5,4,2020-11-03 00:45:16,OphieRose,ZeroWaste

The Lazy Person's Guide to Saving the Planet,"Living a zero-waste lifestyle is all about embracing a more sustainable way of life. But where do you start? It can seem overwhelming at first, but fear not! There are simple swaps you can make that will add up to a big impact over time. 

Reusable Water Bottles:
Say goodbye to single-use plastic water bottles and hello to stylish, durable, and reusable water bottles. Not only do they help reduce waste, but they'll also keep you hydrated in style.

Cloth Napkins:
Make mealtime feel extra fancy by swapping out paper napkins for cloth ones. Not only are they elegant, but they're also more eco-friendly and sustainable. Plus, washing them is a breeze!

Reusable Shopping Bags:
Ditch those pesky plastic bags for good and embrace the power of reusable shopping bags. They come in all shapes and sizes, and they're perfect for grocery runs, shopping trips, or even carrying around your essentials.

Composting:
Turn food scraps into garden gold by composting. Not only will you reduce your waste, but you'll also create nutrient-rich soil for your plants. Talk about a win-win!

Metal or Bamboo Straws:
Sip your drinks in style with metal or bamboo straws. Not only are they stylish and reusable, but they're also great for the environment. No more plastic straws polluting our oceans!

Beeswax Wraps:
Swap out plastic wrap for beeswax wraps. They're washable, reusable, and perfect for keeping your food fresh. Plus, they come in fun colors and patterns that will brighten up your kitchen.

Reusable Coffee Cups:

Meal kits are actually a bit more eco-friendly than grocery shopping,"I know there has been a bit of discussion in the past about meal kits and how wasteful they are. Many of us arent soley concerned with packaging.

Someone did an entire lifecycle analysis of meal kits comparing CO2 emissions of a meal kit against the equivalent meal prepared from a grocery store and published in the journal of resources, conservation and recycling. It's pretty cool if you want to check it out:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344919301703

In case you hit a paywall from elsevier, NPR has a summary of the study: https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/04/22/716010599/meal-kits-have-smaller-carbon-footprint-than-grocery-shopping-study-says

Basically, food waste is an EPIC problem and huge source of emissions and I think it illustrates that we've got a long way to go on that issue. And food waste in the supply chain is also huge. Meal kits optimize supply chain logistics because it's financially rewarding to do so and optmize portion sizes which actually results in a net reduction of CO2. It's also a great example do a complete life cycle analysis.",2,5,2019-05-09 17:52:02,upbeatbasil,ZeroWaste

* Products like Ecosia as well that help you plant trees but do the same thing as Google.
* Using Forest App instead of using TogglTrack for productivity.
* There are some for finance too such as Aspiration and Treecard but I don‚Äôt use them personally.

I know something like this would also be difficult given our addiction to consumption/purchasing. But it would be great if we could almost push some sort of eco-friendly arms race among businesses, instead of this profit-obsession.

PVA is technically a nanoplastic and while companies can claim it ‚Äúbiodegrades‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt actually do that in most wastewater plants‚Äô conditions. It simply [dissolves](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkart/2021/08/08/study-says-up-to-75-of-plastics-from-detergent-pods-enter-the-environment-industry-says-they-safely-biodegrade/amp/) into nanoplastics, so the result is plastics in our water and our bodies.

Anyway, after this, I switched from laundry detergent sheets (PVA binding) and pods (PVA casing) to powder laundry detergent. It took a few to find one that worked with really soiled outdoor clothing, but I settled on Nellie‚Äôs Laundry Soda which comes in reusable tins. This has been working great for me, and looks like there are tons of other great options on the market for powder laundry detergents. That being said, if you still have recommendations/ alternatives, I would love to hear them!

I want to do the same for the dishwasher, but it looks like this is a whole other beast. Is it just me or are there like NO detergent powder options? I‚Äôm in USA and all I see are pods (which are all PVA coated) and the loose detergents that do exist are not eco-friendly and have fragrances.
I‚Äôm looking to replace my current dishwasher pods because they are PVA coated. 

I tried Seventh Generation detergent powder which comes in a cardboard box, but even with 1 tbsp prewash + 2 tbsp in wash compartment, this just doesn‚Äôt work on any sauces, smoothies, or dried on food so I had to wash dishes by hand before loading the dishwasher, and that wastes water and time. I also tried Blueland tablets which did work but it took 2 tablets (one in the compartment and one broken up on the door for pre-wash) for it to work so that‚Äôs more expensive. Also, I don‚Äôt want to use Cascade or anything that contains dyes and fragrances. I do use rinse-aid so that‚Äôs not an issue. 

I‚Äôm curious what everyone is using currently! Does anyone have recommendations for PVA free, biodegradable, eco-friendly packaging, and actually effective dishwasher detergent?

How to teach kids the importance of reducing waste,"I have a 9 year old child who goes between their mom‚Äôs house and dad & my house every other week. When here, we recycle, I focus on buying anything that‚Äôs not plastic, and try to instill better eating habits so they aren‚Äôt throwing away piles of food. At the other house, I‚Äôm afraid to say those kinds of efforts are not attempted, the child is allowed to pick at their food and usually throws half of it away or says she doesn‚Äôt like it all and mom makes something else or goes out to buy whatever is asked for, and there is a HEAVY emphasis on buying indiscriminately- new toys or clothes or random junk both online and any time we‚Äôve been out together - at this point it‚Äôs sadly piled up to a hoarder situation. 

The child is really pretty good here but it‚Äôs a completely opposite story at moms so I‚Äôm at a loss as to how to instill in them why we maintain more sustainable practices as a lifestyle without throwing the other home under the bus.

Eco friendly Laundry Detergent?,"Hey folks, 

Hope everyone is doing well! 

So I saw on social media an ad about Tru Earth and how it's really eco friendly, works well on laundry, can buy scented or fragrance free. Plus it's recyclable, vegan and cruelty free. I've just recently looked into this one, but then found other options like Dropps, Earth Breeze, Eco Nuts and Disolve. 

I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with these items or ones of similar type; whether good or bad. So that I can make a more informed decision. 

Thanks! üòä

Edit: Just for more info; I'm a PSW/Nurse so I deal with bodily fluids and the like. I have scrubs that are of lighter colors so I want to know how well these detergents will act on those things.

anybody else been disappointed with eco friendly shoes?,"I got Vessis during a sale this February for about $112. Nice shoes. Lots of issues. 

Took forever to break in, not comfortable at first, and are not good for long athletic walks. So walking to class or doing your daily routine is fine but a 1-3 mile walk starts to get uncomfortable. 

These shoes fit differently every few weeks because they stretched so quickly. I have been trying them tighter and tighter to stay on (after already buying them a half size too small) and yesterday I noticed they were no longer waterproof which is incredibly disappointing. I was walking through a wet field and my feet got wet. 

I will buy them again in the future when I need new shoes but they will only be for commuting and regular daily activities. As someone that lives in one of the coldest and wettest places in the continental US having dry feet in the winter feels amazing. They just need a little more care than regular tennis shoes. 

I'm looking for another pair of eco friendly shoes I can actually go on runs wearing but I am wondering if they will still be good in a few months like the vessis. My budget tops out at around $100 and so many eco friendly running shoes are $150+ and I'm just not sure if it's worth it.",12,7,2022-05-26 17:18:34,DontRememberMe21,ZeroWaste
"How ""eco-friendly"" are these cleaning sprays really? I'm sceptical..","I found this company that seemed promising called ""smol products"". They sell dishwasher and washing machine tablets that deliver to your door, but more interestingly they sell spray bottle tablets. You use refillable bottles, so just fill them with water and pop a tablet in. I thought it was such a good idea (that could maybe be applied to many more products), BUT then I found out that to buy these capsules you first need to buy THEIR spray bottles! ...........

I have perfectly good spray bottles I can reuse already, so why am I forced to buy theirs? Doesn't seem very eco-friendly to me. On top of this, are these sprays more effective/necessary? I've seen recipes online for homemade cleaning sprays/surface cleaners but I have yet to try them. Though, I'd most likely need to buy products in other packaging to make these homemade sprays anyway.

Whats your opinion on this company? And do you already use homemade cleaning sprays? Any specific recipes I should try? Thanks!

**Update:** I sent them a message and their response was ""Our formulations have been developed to meet dilutions as specified on our bottles and to maintain performance and stability within our bottles üôå we cannot ensure this will be the case if our products are contained in other bottles made from other materials üòî so it is not possible to order the tablets alone, sorry!"". While I do understand that it may be a safety precaution, I think that's quite a lame excuse. Once I've got their bottles I can then use their tablets as I wish, and in whatever bottle I want if I'm adamant. So yes, of course they can mention the safest way to use their product and encourage their customers to use their company's bottles but at the end of the day consumers will do what they want and if they use the product incorrectly (not as directed) then that's their own responsibility. It just seems like a way to force people to buy their bottles, chances are using your own would be perfectly safe. I still believe there should be an option to buy the tablets alone.

**Update 2:** Which? has a [good article](https://www.which.co.uk/news/2021/03/smol-and-other-laundry-detergent-subscriptions-are-they-worth-trying/) comparing different eco-oriented, uk-based brands if you want to compare

Recyclable furniture made out of material extracted from ocean and wildlife cleanups.,"Hey everyone,

I'm reaching out to seek some insights and advice on a topic that's close to my heart which is sustainable furniture.

As someone deeply passionate about sustainability and eco-friendly living, I've been exploring different ways to contribute to a circular economy. One idea that really interested myself is the concept of utilising waste materials from ocean and wildlife cleanups to create sustainable furniture solutions.

I'm interested in hearing from the community about your experiences with sustainable or recyclable furniture. Have you come across any innovative designs or brands that prioritise eco-consciousness? What are your thoughts on the feasibility and potential impact of using reclaimed materials for furniture production?

I'm eager to learn from your insights and perspectives, so please feel free to share your thoughts, recommendations, or any resources you think might be helpful.

Looking forward to engaging with you all!

Zero Waste Homemaking,"I am closing on a house later this month, and after a year of battling my parents' bad habits, I'm excited to be able to run my house as zero-waste and eco-friendly as possible. My goal is to help my son grow up with a healthy respect for the environment and a love for nature, so lots of our projects will be done together over time.

What are your best tips for zero-waste homemaking, especially with a little baby?

These are the major elements we've got so far:

\- Solar panels (came with the house)

\- Kitchen compost and eventually a raised-bed veggie garden once we're a bit more established. I also plan to line the back fence with berry bushes, as they grow really really well where we live (and are native)

\- Installing bidets

\- furnishing with estate sale furniture and using what we've got from our old apartment as much as possible

\- Thrifted/handed down dishware

\- Stainless steel cookware (as opposed to Teflon/nonstick)

\- I chose a house walking distance from school on purpose to kill the commute

\- SO takes train to work, and I WFH so very little car activity

\- Plastic bags are banned in our state (<3) so we use re-usable bags anyway

\- Cooking mostly vegan (some fish)

Are you more likely to buy from a shop that promises its products are eco friendly or made with zero waste? What phrasings or terms does a shop use to say they're eco friendly that catches your eye? What about the shop convinces you they are actually eco friendly and not just green washing? For example, do you want to see pictures or video of the packaging to know they don't use bubble wrap?

Understanding the Distinction Between Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Practices,"In this article, we aim to shed light on the key differences between sustainable and eco-friendly practices. By understanding these distinctions, individuals, and businesses can make informed decisions that contribute to a greener and more responsible future.

## The Significance of Sustainability

Sustainability is a concept that has gained significant prominence in recent years due to the pressing need to address environmental concerns. It refers to practices and processes that aim to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability encompasses a broad range of aspects, including social, economic, and environmental factors.

## Exploring Eco-Friendly Practices

On the other hand, eco-friendly practices focus specifically on minimizing harm to the environment. These practices aim to reduce carbon footprint, conserve natural resources, and protect biodiversity. They involve adopting measures that have a lesser impact on the ecosystem, such as using renewable energy sources, implementing waste reduction strategies, and promoting recycling initiatives.

## Differentiating Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Approaches

Waste Disposal Solution for a Cleaner Future,"Waste-to-Energy Technologies:

Integrating waste-to-energy technologies can harness the potential of non-recyclable waste, converting it into renewable energy sources like electricity or heat. This approach not only diverts waste from landfills but also contributes to transition towards cleaner energy alternatives.

Responsible Hazardous Waste Disposal:

Properly handling hazardous waste is crucial to safeguarding public health and the environment. Establishing dedicated facilities for hazardous waste treatment and disposal, along with strict adherence to safety protocols, ensures that potentially harmful materials are managed responsibly.

Public Awareness and Education:

Engaging businesses, employees, and the general public in educational campaigns about industrial waste disposal's significance fosters a culture of environmental responsibility. Raising awareness about the benefits of sustainable waste management encourages active participation and support from all stakeholders.

Incentives for Eco-Friendly Practices:

Encouraging industries to adopt eco-friendly practices can be facilitated through government incentives, tax breaks, or recognition programs. These initiatives not only motivate businesses to prioritize sustainability but also create a competitive advantage for those leading the way in responsible waste disposal.

By embracing a comprehensive approach that involves collaboration, advanced recycling facilities, waste-to-energy technologies, and responsible hazardous waste disposal, the city can mitigate environmental impact while fostering economic growth. Education and incentives play a pivotal role in encouraging businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices, creating a culture of environmental responsibility that benefits  citizens, industries, and the planet at large.

A friend of mine works at a small sustainable business, and she recently shared the intense struggles that homegrown green businesses are facing at the moment.  
  
Trying to make a profit while sticking to their eco-friendly principles has never been harder. From sourcing sustainable materials to ensuring an ethical production line, all while keeping the pricing competitive and still making a decent profit, is a challenge.  
  
I even empathize with customers with tight budgets who end up choosing cheaper, less sustainable options.  
  
So, I‚Äôm really curious to hear from other small sustainable brand owners or folks involved in the industry.  
  
How are you dealing with the premium costs of sustainable production? Are you looking for ways to educate consumers on the value of sustainability to justify higher prices, or are you using other cost-saving measures without compromising your sustainable values?

Sustainable Tips: Making Your Home Sustainable,"Creating a sustainable home involves conscious decisions that contribute to a healthier planet. Begin by optimizing energy usage through the integration of energy-efficient appliances and LED lighting. These choices not only reduce electricity consumption but also lower your carbon footprint.

Next, consider incorporating eco-friendly materials like reclaimed wood or recycled metal in your home decor and construction projects. These materials not only add a unique touch to your space but also promote sustainable practices. Proper insulation is key to minimizing energy loss and, in turn, decreasing the need for excessive heating or cooling.

You may also want to consider installing [home water filters](https://plastic.education/home-water-filters/). Not only do they enhance the taste and quality of your drinking water, but they also significantly reduce the need for single-use plastic bottles, minimizing plastic pollution. 

Lastly,  cultivate a green environment within your home by planting native, low-maintenance plants that require minimal water and pesticides. This not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also contributes to biodiversity.

Understanding ESG Scores: What They Are and How They're Calculated,"ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores are a powerful tool that assesses a company's performance and sustainability in key areas. These scores provide investors, stakeholders, and consumers with insights into how well a company is managing its environmental impact, social responsibilities, and corporate governance practices.

# How ESG Scores are Calculated:

* **Environmental Factors:** This includes a company's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, manage waste, conserve resources, and promote eco-friendly practices.
* **Social Factors:** ESG scores consider a company's treatment of its employees, community engagement, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and commitment to human rights.
* **Governance Factors:** Corporate governance evaluates the company's leadership, board structure, executive compensation, transparency, and anti-corruption policies.

ESG scores are calculated based on data collected from various sources, such as regulatory filings, sustainability reports, and public statements. These data points are then analyzed to generate a comprehensive score that reflects a company's overall ESG performance.

Investors and stakeholders use ESG scores to make informed decisions that align with their values and sustainability goals. By supporting companies with higher ESG scores, they contribute to a more responsible and resilient business landscape.

Remember, ESG scores provide valuable insights into a company's commitment to sustainability, ethics, and responsible business practices. They play a crucial role in shaping a better future for both businesses and the planet

&#x200B;

*""Eco-friendly technologies are of great significance to agricultural sustainability due to the environmental damage caused by agricultural activities. Here, we report a wind and rain energy-driven electrical stimulation system for enhancing crop production. The system is based on an all-weather triboelectric nanogenerator (AW-TENG), which is composed of a bearing-and-hair structured triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a raindrop-driven TENG. Treated by the self-generated high-voltage electric field, the system can increase pea seeds germination speed by \~26.3% and pea yield by \~17.9%.*¬†

*By harvesting environmental wind and raindrop energy, the AW-TENG can be used to drive various agricultural sensors for optimizing plant growth. This work provides a fresh direction for self-powered systems in safe, efficient and eco-friendly agricultural production improvement and may profoundly contribute to the construction of a sustainable economy.*

¬†*Conclusions*  
*In  summary, we demonstrated an environmental mechanical energy-driven  electrical stimulation system based on AW-TENG composed of a BH-TENG and  an R-TENG. With the advantages of high output, low friction and  excellent robustness, the AW-TENG was used to speed up the germination  and growth of peas directly. After the treatment of the self-powered  electric field, notable increases in the germination speed and yield of  peas were obtained, mainly due to electric field-induced physiological  activity enhance- ment. Moreover, the AW-TENG was used to provide  all-weather self-powered agricultural sensing services to optimize the  strategies of crop cultivation. This great breakthrough in the  construction of SESS without additional power sources and complex  circuits may indicate that the designed SESS can meet the diversified  challenges of agricultural production. Given its unique properties of  self-powering, cost-effectiveness, low start-up conditions and  all-weather energy harvesting capability, SESS is a sustainable and  pragmatic method for converting natural energy for crop yield improving  purposes. This can be immediately and widely applied to various  production activities in agriculture and ultimately provides a promise  for reducing agricultural pollution as well as increasing agricultural  production. Meanwhile, this work shows scope for the extensive  application of TENGs in agricultural activities towards a more  sustainable society.""*",14,0,2023-04-04 11:08:06,scribbyshollow,Sustainable

I was looking to switch my home to using reusable bags for shopping, and I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for particular company? Is there a company that sells reusable bags and donates any of their profits for a cause? I figured I might as well purchase from a seller that uses eco-friendly materials to make the bags and maybe also donates for a higher cause.

"To save the Earth, rethink the economy","That's what David Attenborough said in his latest book Life on Planet Earth,  a must-read.   
Indeed, without you knowing, banks invest in fossil-fuel companies. So the more you save money, the more it is used for that.

That's why I think if we want to have some impact, we need to change the way we **spend, save and invest**. That's why I am on a mission to build a better ""bank"" that will do exactly this: 

* Educate people on spending less (reduce consumerism) and incentivise them to buy eco-friendly
* Helping people to invest for their future in companies that are trying to go carbon-neutral

Susatianable Living: Bang for the buck,"Sustainable living is a lifestyle choice you make to tackle the dangerous consumerism mindset in you. Let me help you understand how small changes can add up into big savings, for your pockets as well as for the environment. Yes, it might feel like the little things you do for the environment are just a drop in the vast ocean of unawareness, but keep in mind that your action inspires others.

We are all trapped in the vicious circle of life, spending most of our time working, nose to the grind with no energy left to think about our way of living and our contributions to the environment. We hear people around us say over and over again that living sustainably isn‚Äôt attainable for them due to financial concerns. But what if I tell you that sustainable living is actually about turning back the clock to the olden days before the heavy dependence on plastics and single-use disposables were present. You can start your journey towards a greener living by practising responsible consumption and civic-mindedness.

## Here are a few ways you can let Mother Earth know that YOU CARE:

* Ditch the plastic bags on your next run to the grocery store. Instead, opt for reusable [cloth bags](https://upciclo.com/fashion/accessories/bags-n-all/grocery-bag.html). They are much cuter options and hey, you can even customise them and add your art to them!
* Bring your¬†[paper containers](https://upciclo.com/home-kitchen/kitchen/plates.html)¬†or¬†[tumblers](https://upciclo.com/home-kitchen/kitchen/plates.html)¬†when you visit the bakery. Most shops encourage customers to bring their servers these days.
* Make the quick switch to wooden cutlery that are reusable. Bid adieu to that single-use plastic cutlery that is crowding up your kitchen space.
* When shopping for clothing items, invest in some good quality¬†[long-lasting clothing](https://upciclo.com/fashion/apparels.html). Slow, sustainable and ethically made fashion trumps your easy, cheap fast fashion any day.¬†
* Try thrifting! I love finding a good thrift piece. It‚Äôs a great date idea with a friend or a significant other to go shopping at thrift stores and finding great deals for previously loved clothing.¬†
* Go paperless. Switch to digital letters, notices and invitations. Paper invitations are so useless in my opinion, as the only purpose it serves is to let the receiver know a date and time. Do this digitally instead!
* If you have kids in your household, invest in¬†[wooden toys and educational games](https://upciclo.com/upcycled-toys.). They are more durable, child safe and most importantly environmental-friendly than classic plastic products.
* Bamboo straws are a great alternative to plastic straws and a more durable and reusable than paper straws.
* One of the most talked-about methods is to buy produce in bulk. Grab a glass mason jar and shop from the bulk section of the grocery store. This helps to avoid unnecessary food packaging as well as save some money!

Here are my 20 cents. if you put yourself in an earth-conscious mindset, how much you earn doesn't matter. You will find a way to balance an eco-friendly lifestyle while being economically responsible. Find a unique plan for yourself and make it a routine. Voila! And before you know it, we have created yet another friend of Mother Earth.",8,0,2021-07-14 05:35:56,watermeloncougar,Sustainable
The History and Evolution of Straws,"Every day, Americans use 500 million drinking straws, and the majority of them are single-use plastic versions ([NPS.gov](https://www.nps.gov/articles/straw-free.htm)). Since plastic does not biodegrade, the seemingly innocent straw we get with our drinks can cause a lot of damage.

Until the [environmental impact of plastic straws](https://byndgrn.com/blogs/news-1/the-impact-of-straws-on-our-environment) became widely known, you were rarely asked whether or not you would like to have a straw with your drink. To us, straws were just another utensil that we used without knowing that they have a fascinating history ‚Äî and an equally interesting future.

## When Were Straws Invented?

Over 5,000 years ago, ancient Mesopotamians fashioned drinking straws from a variety of materials including gold and wood. Unlike the straws we use today, they were extremely long and sturdy. Instead of being used for drinking from cups, they were designed for sitting on the floor and drinking beer from heavy, immovable vats. ([NBCNews.com](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/ancient-scepters-actually-straws-communal-boozing-researchers-say-rcna12545))

Other civilizations were found to utilize reeds and grasses as Mother Nature‚Äôs straws. However, the grassy taste and gritty particles left a lot to be desired.

Although they are still used in native teas, they were rarely used on what we might consider a conventional dinner table. That is ‚Äî until the powerhouse known as the paper straw entered the picture.

## The Invention of the Paper Straw

### Who Invented The Straw?

In the late 1880s, a man by the name of **Marvin Stone** stepped away from designing cigarette holders and began experimenting with straws. His first prototypes involved wrapping and gluing paper around pencils, but he quickly found that the glue deteriorated in liquid. This caused the straws to not hold together, as well as the potential for a bad taste in your drink.

Not to be deterred, Stone then began to work with wax-coated manilla paper. With specifications that included that the hole is too small for a lemon seed to pass through, the ancient straw got a new design. By 1890, his factory was solely manufacturing his latest invention known as the paper drinking straw. ([Invention.si.edu](https://invention.si.edu/straight-truth-about-flexible-drinking-straw))

## The Origins of Bendy Straws

The straw took another step in its evolution in 1932 when Joseph Friedman‚Äôs daughter had a unique issue. Although she enjoyed drinking from straws, they were often too tall for her to reach. With her needs in mind, he [created a flexible straw](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-appreciate-bendy-straw-180965014/#:~:text=The%20first%20drinking%20straw%20of,man%20named%20Marvin%20Chester%20Stone.) that would allow sipping from any number of angles.

Despite booming contracts with hospitals that loved them for their patients, the paper versions of bendy straws were short-lived. The machinery needed to create commercial amounts of paper straws was not complete until 1947, plastic straws soon took over.¬†

## Plastic - The Modern Drinking Straw

By the 1960s technology had made it easier to mass manufacture items made from plastic, including the drinking straw ([National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/news-plastic-drinking-straw-history-ban)). Modern technology had made it easier to create different types of plastic drinking products like stirring sticks and cocktail skewers. In fact, one American company still makes over three hundred types of drinking utensils.

Despite efforts to reduce the number of plastic straws being used today, Americans still use over 500 million of them per day. Since the majority of them are not biodegradable, most end up in the earth‚Äôs waterways or lining landfills. ([TRVST.org](https://www.trvst.world/waste-recycling/plastic-pollution/plastic-straws-infographic/#info))

## Environmental Impact of Drinking Straws

The drinking straw industry is currently a $3 billion per year market. Yet only one percent of all drinking straws sold are considered biodegradable or earth friendly. Staggering estimates say that the number of plastic straws in our waterways is [close to eight billion](https://www.questrmg.com/2020/02/27/plastic-straw-pollution/).

A large number of them end up obstructing wildlife habitats and being ingested by the animals living there. Even more, problems are caused when the straws start to break down. Rather than biodegrading, plastic straws end up becoming smaller and smaller particles. Those particles further pollute the air, the soil, and the water ‚Äî things that all life, even human life, needs to survive.

## The Trend Back to Environmentally Conscious Straws

The ‚Äú[Be Straw Free](https://www.ecocycle.org/bestrawfree)‚Äù campaign began when a nine-year-old aspiring scientist discovered that over five school busses worth of straws were thrown out every day. As he began to ask businesses to get involved, the awareness began to spread. More and more restaurants and diners are opting to go without the straw or offering more eco-friendly options such as paper or [plant-based straw alternatives](https://byndgrn.com/collections/pha-straws).

There is no doubt that you have seen more and more alternative straws or reusable straws entering the market. Typically¬†these include stainless steel straws or silicone straws, which can be used over and over again.

Additionally, many manufacturers, like beyondGREEN, have taken paper straws to a new level. With plant-based alternatives that naturally break down and you can have a more sustainable option.

## The beyondGREEN Solution

beyondGREEN's [Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) straws](https://byndgrn.com/collections/pha-straws) have all of the properties of traditional plastics, but without the environmental damaging side-affects. Made with Nodax PHA and manufactured and marketed in the USA. These straws are far superior to any other in the market. beyondGREEN PHA straws are the land & marine safe method to sip sustainably.¬†",1,1,2023-06-27 18:18:14,lundmarket62,Sustainable

In particular, by 2030 these guys promise to ensure zero waists. However, as practice with companies from other industries shows, promises often turn out to be just another marketing ploy: materials that are labeled as recyclable, as a result, are no less harmful to the environment than their non-eco-friendly counterparts, human labor, to reduce the cost of goods, still resembles slavery, and the production of Cruelty-Free goods still uses animal components. Of course, these companies pay with their reputation and multi-million lawsuits, but they still continue to function. In short, what do you think about Facebook? Will they keep their promises?

California‚Äôs Straw Ban: Everything You Need to Know,"**Wondering if California banned plastic straws and what other states are doing? Here‚Äôs everything you need to know...**

The sunshine state, California, has been making some major changes over the years that have made it a leader in ‚Äúgoing green‚Äù. Back in 2014, they became the first state to enact a statewide ban of single-use plastic bags at large retail stores. This ban brought a minimum 10-cent charge to use alternative recycled paper bags, reusable plastic bags, and compostable bags at some locations. Read more about this ban from the [National Conference of State Legislatures](https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx).

Another major ban that California has made since the 2014 ban on single-use plastic bags, is the ban on single-use plastic straws. This is just yet another step in the process of eliminating the use of single-use plastics that can harm our planet. According to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/us/plastic-straws-banned-in-california/index.html), Governor Jerry Brown has said that ‚Äúplastic, in all forms, are choking our planet‚Äù. He is hoping that the straw ban will make people more aware of the issue.

## Did California Ban Straws?

Plastic straws are not banned in California. However, [Assembly Bill No. 1884](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1884) has drastically limited the of single-use plastic straws in full-service, sit-down restaurants.

This ban prohibits servers from providing plastic straws or other plastic utensils without the consumer requesting one. It also comes with a fine for restaurants that are not following the new¬†ban. These restaurants can receive a $25 per day fine until they follow the ban guidelines. This fine maxes out at $300 per year.

What qualifies as a full-service restaurant? A full-service restaurant is one that‚Äôs primary purpose is to serve food that is consumed on the property. To qualify as full-service, it must be a restaurant where customers are served their food at an assigned table.

Although this act does not completely ban the use of single-use straws, it does have a major impact. Some cities and counties within California have also implemented their own bans. These [bans](https://www.sunset.com/home-garden/green-living/straw-ban-info-guide) are similar and some are even more limiting on the use of single-use plastics.

## Are Straws Illegal in California?

So, does this mean that straws are illegal in the state of California? No, they are not illegal, but hopefully, the ban will bring more awareness to the issue and drastically limit California‚Äôs plastic straw usage.

Plastic straws are in the top ten contributors of plastic marine debris across the entire globe. With the USA using millions of single-use plastic straws each day, this will only get worse over time.

Most recycling machines aren‚Äôt capable of recycling straws and to date, the world has only recycled 9% of all used plastic. This statistic hasn‚Äôt changed since 2012 because of the increased usage of single-use plastics ([OurLastStraw.org](https://www.ourlaststraw.org/facts-figures)).

## Other States Following Suit

It‚Äôs clear that single-use plastic, including straws, has a huge impact on our environment. It has been estimated that approximately 2,000 tons of plastic straws enter the world‚Äôs oceans each year ([Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2018-04-science-amount-straws-plastic-pollution.html)). Plastic pollution is at an all-time high and many states and companies are taking action.

üì∑

Since the ban of single-use plastic bags in 2014, seven other states have implemented a statewide ban as well. There are also several cities throughout the USA that have bans and fees implemented. You can learn more about the states and cities with bans [here](https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx).

Oregon also followed suit with California by banning single-use plastic straws at restaurants unless it is specifically requested by the consumer. There are also many other states with partial bans as well.

Some companies like Starbucks, American Airlines, Royal Caribbean, Aramark, and Disney are also taking steps to limit single-use straws.

"Plastics, Fossil Fuels, and Fast Fashion are damaging our environment...But there is one super plant that could have the solution.","&#x200B;

‚ÄúHemp. Aka the most versatile plant on the planet. Hemp is the only plant that can feed you, clothe you, create a home for you, and provide you with natural beauty products.‚ÄùSource: MindBodyGreen.org 

We are all becoming much more aware of our impacts on the environment, and there is a lot of talk about how to cut down plastic use, slow down fast fashion, and alternative fuels for cars. Well, i'm here to let you know that there is one plant that could be the answer to all of these problems, and more! 

That plant is hemp. 

Hemp cultivation is becoming more widespread, and as more hemp is grown, it is becoming a highly regarded resource to help make the world a more sustainable and eco friendly place.  Hemp is super multifunctional and has proved itself one of the most versatile natural fibres out there. 

‚ÄúHemp has been cultivated on planet earth for over 10,000 years. It has been an important source of food and fibre with references dating back to ancient China and Mesopotamia. Applications of hemp plants evolved from simple rope and coarse woven fabric to paper and sail cloth.‚Äù Source : HempTrade.ca 

Did you know? As a farmer in parts of the USA in the 1600s, it was actually mandatory to grow Hemp on a percentage of your land. Each farmer had to dedicate land specifically to Hemp because it was so widely used. This sadly changed when the government ruled it an illegal plant due to its association with the cannabis plant. 

Here's a list of current and up and coming uses for the super plant: 

Clothes - Yup. Brands such as Hempton Apparel are now bringing out hemp clothing, it is perfect for clothes because is is durable, resistant to odour, UV protective, breathable, comfy, and moisture wicking. 

Hemp oil - Hemp oil has many uses and benefits, people swear by it. In fact, it has started to become so popular in Australia, there have been cases of it selling out and being hard to get hold of. Hemp oil contains Omega 3 and Omega 6 which are said to help inflammation, so many people with arthritis are using it.  

Hemp moisturiser and skin care - Hemp is used in face moisturisers, and even to help with the aging process, and help treat acne. 

Nutrition - Hemp seeds are becoming routine in the diets of many health conscious people. Why? It is great protein (popular in vegans and vegetarians), it also contains Omega 3 and 6 fatty oils, Omega 9, Minerals (Calcium, Iron, Magnesium), and Vitamins.

Food - Not only can you get hemp seeds, and hearts, but people are starting to experiment with hemp in food more, such as Hemp burgers! 

Hemp milk - Yup. There‚Äôs a new contender for non dairy milk. Hemp milk is pretty darn good for you too. It is lactose, soy, and gluten free and high in fatty acids and proteins. It is very nutritious, and people have even started making it themselves at home. 

Hempcrete - Hemp has been used as a replacement for concrete for many years as I found out last year, and is now becoming increasingly in demand. 

I‚Äôm certainly no expert in hempcrete, concrete or any other elements of construction, so here's a bit on hempcrete from a far more knowledgeable source:

‚ÄúIt has great energy efficiency. It maintains a steady temperature. It doesn't shrink, so there are no crack lines. It is a breathable material.‚Äù  Source: Houseplanninghelp.com 

Rope - One of the oldest uses for hemp, possibly the original.  Hemp has been used in rope in all kinds of trades, but is famous for its uses in shipping. 

‚ÄúIn 1997, a hemp rope dating back to 26900 BC was found in Czechoslovakia, making it the oldest known object to be associated with cannabis.‚Äù Source: Ancient Origins 

Soap - Hemp is known to be gentle on sensitive skin, as well as being moisturising, so it makes the perfect ingredient for natural soap. 

Fuel - Hemp biofuel is being discussed as a possibility. As we are becoming more conscious and trying to remove the use of fossil fuels, scientists are looking for a way to make an environmentally and sustainable fuel, and hemp is being talked about a lot right now, so watch this space! 

Sunscreen - With it‚Äôs natural UV protection properties, and it's moisturising feeling, it has started to be used in making sunscreen, and with much less harmful ingredients, compared with some other options on the market. 

Beer - Heck yes. Hemp beer is on the market. Gluten free, vegan friendly beer with hemp in it. Because, why not?! 

Pet food - Because we can‚Äôt keep this hemp goodness all to ourselves - It‚Äôs great for our pets too! There is currently cat and dog food enriched with hemp oil, and some brands have been recommended by vets. 

Pet bedding - A safe, natural option for pet bedding, which offers comfort as well as antimicrobial properties. 

Paper - Hemp paper has been around for years - in fact it can be traced back to around 200 BC in China. 

Interesting Fact:

The first draft of the declaration of independence was written on hemp paper.

Protein powder -  I must admit, nutrition definitely isn't one of my expertise so I looked over a few websites to learn a bit more about this. Turns out hemp protein powder is meant to be pretty good. 

‚ÄúHemp protein powder is a high-quality plant-based protein that contains 20 amino acids ‚Äî the building blocks of protein. Protein is crucial for developing, growing and maintaining muscles, tissues and vital organs. It also helps boost metabolism and increases fat-burning.‚Äù

Nappies/diapers - Hemp nappies for babies are becoming a big thing. The main reasons hemp is so good for diapers are; It is environmentally friendly (we already know this), it‚Äôs baby friendly - the fabric is tested and certified to be safe to use on young babies and children, it‚Äôs durable, it‚Äôs soft, it‚Äôs stretchy, and it‚Äôs absorbent. 

To clean soil - I talked about this in a post recently, but it's a valid one for this list, and I love talking about it, because I just think it‚Äôs so wonderful. Hemp produces high quantities of biomass, which returns to the soil and decomposes, giving nutrients back into the soil.  Not only that but it also is also able to absorb heavy metals and pollutants (Phytovolatilization). 

An example of this is:

Hemp was used to help clean up after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in  Ukraine in 1986, due to its ability to absorb radioactive toxins from the ground.

Shoes - This is quite a new thing as far as i can tell, but i‚Äôve seen a couple of brands of sneakers coming out with hemp trainers, as a vegan, and sustainable option. 

Plastic - This is beginning to be talked about. The idea of plastic being replaced with ‚Äòbioplastics‚Äô, including hemp as one of the runners. 

Cars - Believe it or not, this is actually a piece of history, which may well make a comeback. Henry Ford made a prototype hemp car back in 1941, which was also designed to run on hemp fuel. If you read up, it seems that it may also become a thing of the future... I think Mr Ford was definitely well ahead of his time there, and onto something. Time will tell. 

I really believe this is just the beginning for hemp, it‚Äôs a fibre that has a highly growing market, and now you know why. You‚Äôll be hearing about hemp a lot more in future.  Hopefully it really can help to turn this environmental crisis around, because its negative impacts are generally much less than current material we are overusing. 

Pretty impressive hey? If you know of any other uses for this magnificent plant, please comment below, I'd love to hear of any others you may have. 

I have just made my own brand of hemp shirts, which I am currently crowdfunding to help get off the ground.  They are available now on Kickstarter, check out the link here to snap one up at our Kickstarter prices
