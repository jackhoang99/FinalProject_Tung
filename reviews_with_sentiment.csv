One thing i noticed is certain products on their store you can buy at a lower price on a subscription and that option is set to default, so there was one time that when i purchased i forgot to select ""one time"" instead of ""subscription"" and was shipped a an order I did not really need.

Not my idea of quality or comfort in a slipper. My fault was that i gave them a chance and wore them for about 20-30 minutes inside my home but got a small stain on the suede soles. Since they don't stand behind their quality they emphasize that they cannot accept returns unless they are unused and in same condition as arrived. I do understand trying to avoid someone sending back shoes wore for a year but i also understand good customer service and looking at a long term profit of satisfied customers vs a short term profit of get every buck you can despite the customer satisfaction.Buyer beware, you will not be valued.Date of experience: October 28, 2020",1.0,poor quality product and customer careno cushion at all in sole think of walking on a thin layer of suede and boiled wool not my idea of quality or comfort in a slipper my fault was that i gave them a chance and wore them for about 2030 minutes inside my home but got a small stain on the suede soles since they dont stand behind their quality they emphasize that they cannot accept returns unless they are unused and in same condition as arrived i do understand trying to avoid someone sending back shoes wore for a year but i also understand good customer service and looking at a long term profit of satisfied customers vs a short term profit of get every buck you can despite the customer satisfactionbuyer beware you will not be valueddate of experience october 28 2020,positive

I did get the money refunded, but EarthHero obviously kept ALL of my credit card information on its site. Yesterday my daughter (for whom I bought the duffel) informed me that the color (Green). When I went to purchase the item, the site had ALL my credit card info., including the security code. I thought that was strange that I wasn't prompted to fill it in. Less than 24 hours after EarthHero charged my credit card, I got an email saying that the item was Out of Stock and trying to cajole me to settle for an entirely different color. I wonder if there were any green bags after all? I know that I will be refunded, but it irks me that they still have all my credit card information. I have asked them to scrub it.

earthhero.com,BAF,1 review,US,"Jul 13, 2022","Not Actually SustainableThis company does not have sustainability at its core. Of course businesses need to make money, but when a company says it values sustainability above all else and helping consumers be more sustainable, they should not make concessions to make more money. There are many brands they have on their website that go against EarthHero’s sourcing principles, but they refuse to discontinue those products. I received expired product and the packaging was made from virgin plastic, even after I asked if it was recycled because I thought plastic was not something they carried anyway. It also seems very unusual that they had a diverse team a few months ago and now it is all white employees. Sustainable and ethical go beyond the products a company sells and I do not believe this company walks the walk. There are plenty of other companies that are doing it better so I would encourage others to check out package free or public goods as they are closer to the ideals that EarthHero claims to stand behind.Date of experience: July 13, 2022",1.0,not actually sustainablethis company does not have sustainability at its core of course businesses need to make money but when a company says it values sustainability above all else and helping consumers be more sustainable they should not make concessions to make more money there are many brands they have on their website that go against earthheros sourcing principles but they refuse to discontinue those products i received expired product and the packaging was made from virgin plastic even after i asked if it was recycled because i thought plastic was not something they carried anyway it also seems very unusual that they had a diverse team a few months ago and now it is all white employees sustainable and ethical go beyond the products a company sells and i do not believe this company walks the walk there are plenty of other companies that are doing it better so i would encourage others to check out package free or public goods as they are closer to the ideals that earthhero claims to stand behinddate of experience july 13 2022,positive

I trialled them at home before moving them into use in my off grid, eco hospitality business. Am very happy with the results. At first I thought the colours of the sprays were a bit bright for things that are supposed to be so gentle. But the colour coding is useful and keeps everything really simple. I have just purchased a full set of the 4 cleaning sprays for each of my eco cabins and now the cleaning team will ONLY use these sprays as we can trust they are gentle and safe for our off grid waste water treatment. Plus we won't be throwing out empty bottles when they run out, the team will simply be dropping another tab into the bottle, filling it up with water and off we go.

I was originally intrigued but sceptical, so thought the best way was to try it for myself.The attraction was a laundry product with no waste, no plastic, a subscription model and 100% recyclable packaging. And, as a bonus, it takes up much less room in the cupboard than all those plastic boxes other brands use.The results are, in my opinion, that it cleans just as well as any of the big brand products but with significantly less environmental impact.This is now the only laundry product we use.Date of experience: October 27, 2022",5.0,cleanest greenest laundry detergentive been using eco laundry detergent sheets from the green company for around four months now i was originally intrigued but sceptical so thought the best way was to try it for myselfthe attraction was a laundry product with no waste no plastic a subscription model and 100 recyclable packaging and as a bonus it takes up much less room in the cupboard than all those plastic boxes other brands usethe results are in my opinion that it cleans just as well as any of the big brand products but with significantly less environmental impactthis is now the only laundry product we usedate of experience october 27 2022,positive
